@mdavidpayne I am referring to contraception not abortion.The point is, abortion only is 3% of what Planned Parenthood does and Kyl knows it

2011-04-17 14:19:05
https://www.twitter.com/georgetakei/status/59621910622908416
@macguyinnc goodness, not aborted! PP counsels contraception! That's the whole point of Kyl's misinformation.

2011-04-17 14:20:05
https://www.twitter.com/georgetakei/status/59622162310500353
@jones1130 I don't mean aborted, heavens. I meant contraception options, which is what PP offers. That's why Kyl was spreading lies.

2011-04-17 14:23:14
https://www.twitter.com/georgetakei/status/59622952727085056
@KimHarano I of course mean that she could have used contraception, which is what PP offers 97% of the time.Abortion is Kyl's misinformation

2011-04-17 14:30:19
https://www.twitter.com/georgetakei/status/59624735633444865
@rbhoya Brad? This is GT. But I don't think it's too far to wish she'd had access to contraception. (Abortion=Kyl's lie about what PP does.)

2011-04-17 14:32:28
https://www.twitter.com/georgetakei/status/59625275633307648
@ECFahrner I think it's perfectly fine to wish she'd had access to contraception. Abortion is Kyl's lie about what PP is about.

2011-04-17 14:34:44
https://www.twitter.com/georgetakei/status/59625847610552321
@dave_worrell I feel it is not hateful to wish she'd had contraceptive counseling. Abortion is Kyl's lie about what PP mostly does.

2011-04-17 14:35:53
https://www.twitter.com/georgetakei/status/59626136778444800
@zarathuse I am implying she should have had contraception available to her. Remember, PP being about abortion is Kyl's lie.

2011-04-17 14:36:33
https://www.twitter.com/georgetakei/status/59626305058123776
@yuweiquan Exactly my point!

2011-04-17 15:24:51
https://www.twitter.com/georgetakei/status/59638459257720832
@dave_worrell I'm suggesting Kyl's mother should have had access to contraception. (Abortion and PP is Kyl's lie--thus the hashtag.)

2011-04-17 16:05:34
https://www.twitter.com/georgetakei/status/59648705661378562
@ECFahrner I implied she should have used contraception. PP rarely does abortions--that's the whole problem with Kyl's lie.

2011-04-17 16:07:17
https://www.twitter.com/georgetakei/status/59649139520176129
@jones1130 I am a Buddhist, so of course not.  Others misread my tweet, but I see now that Kyl's lie has people believing it.  Sad.

1) I am addressing this to all who voted to defeat Donald Trump and what he represents. We may not have prevailed, but we must not despair.

2016-11-09 05:46:34
https://www.twitter.com/georgetakei/status/796227462569095168
2) Many of you are, like me, in a state of shock. This does not feel like the America you love and honor. We are in unchartered waters.

2016-11-09 05:46:53
https://www.twitter.com/georgetakei/status/796227538871783424

2016-11-09 05:47:08
https://www.twitter.com/georgetakei/status/796227604479180800
4) We must stand up defiantly to any dark or divisive acts, and look out for the most vulnerable among us. It is more important than ever.

2016-11-09 05:47:23
https://www.twitter.com/georgetakei/status/796227664726081538

Sally Yates, the acting AG, had delivered the message to the White House about Flynn's Russia exposure. Betcha Trump was eager to fire her.

Flynn's dealings with Russians while a top Trump campaign advisor must come to light. And Trump must tell the American people what he knew.
