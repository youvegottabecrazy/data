GOP waited too long to replace Trump. Ballots are printed and votes are being cast in several states. We are the only conservative ticket.

2016-10-08 13:24:42

https://www.twitter.com/evan_mcmullin/status/784748623808565248

I believe our best next step is to make it a political imperative for members of Congress, especially Republicans, to stand up to Trump.
