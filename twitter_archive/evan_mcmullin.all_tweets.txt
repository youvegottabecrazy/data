GOP waited too long to replace Trump. Ballots are printed and votes are being cast in several states. We are the only conservative ticket.

2016-10-08 13:24:42
https://www.twitter.com/evan_mcmullin/status/784746343763943424
By election day, we'll be on the ballot or registered as a write-in in 43 states including TX &amp; CA. A new GOP nominee could not match that.

2016-10-08 13:33:46
https://www.twitter.com/evan_mcmullin/status/784748623808565248
Calls for Pence, Trump's number one enabler, to replace the nominee may be a feel good exit for GOP leaders, but it isnât actually feasible.

To do otherwise is self-defeating. Trump prevailed, in part, because he was able to exploit Americans' divisions, mistrust, and animosity.

https://www.twitter.com/evan_mcmullin/status/810576761964691457
Now we have the opportunity, in fact the need, to claim the common ground that I know is there. That common ground is liberty &amp; equality.

2016-12-18 20:06:02
https://www.twitter.com/evan_mcmullin/status/810576878503346177
Doing so may be easier said than done, but it must be done &amp; we should assist each other in that pursuit, not keep tearing each other apart.

2016-12-18 20:06:31
https://www.twitter.com/evan_mcmullin/status/810577001325166592
