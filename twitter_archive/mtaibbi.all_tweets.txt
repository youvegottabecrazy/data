@Browsergeeser highly unlikely, if they were federal loans. No statute of limitations, no bankruptcy -- zero upside to defaulting on s debt

@The_Puck My whole argument against modern Wall Street has been that it's anti-capitalist, perverted by incestuous ties to the state.

@The_Puck I do consider myself pro capitalist. Again, my beef with Wall Street corruption is that it's anticapitalist, market-perverting

2013-08-08 17:04:56
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/365519007152996352
@The_Puck as for new regulations, I pretty consistently say existing laws are sufficient, just need to be enforced.

2013-08-08 17:06:17
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/365519344052088832
@The_Puck the exceptions are areas where there simply is no law, ie derivatives. There should be exchanges like for stocks. Hardly communism

2013-08-08 17:08:56
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/365520011235823617
@The_Puck I believe the solutions to 99% of Wall St.'s problems are market solutions. Remove implicit bailouts of corrupt companies, and...

2013-08-08 17:10:16
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/365520348390768641
@The_Puck ...those companies will fail. As is, big banks have huge advantage because implicit federal support lowers borrowing costs

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/368064100460662784

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/368066136023506944

@fire350 If you're telling me you own a gun with great sadness and reluctance, that's one thing. But that's not the case, is it?

2013-09-15 16:57:17
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/379287820415684608
@fire350 if you have to ask... In most civilized countries, it's considered crazy to want a gun. And we have places where it's mandatory.

2013-09-15 16:58:23
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/379288094463492097
@fire350 or how about we just raise a generation of people who don't want to be around guns?

2013-09-15 16:58:45
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/379288187790983168
@fire350 so you're saying it's a sartorial choice?

@fire350 the more important question to ask is what percentage of gun crimes are committed with a gun originally sold legally. Ans: 100%

2013-09-15 17:05:34
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/379289904511188992
@fire350 all I know is that if everyone was like me, and refused to so much as touch a gun, there would be no gun violence.

2013-09-15 17:06:29
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/379290132337422336
@fire350 on the other hand, if everyone everywhere was armed, there would at minimum still be massive numbers of accidents.

2013-09-15 17:08:48
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/379290718852091904
@fire350 again, I'm not suggesting guns should be outlawed. I'm suggesting people should choose not to own them because it's uncivilized.

@SottileStephen @ac360 Contracts: not inviolable. They'd have gotten pennies in bankruptcy. States everywhere abrogating pension contracts.

@SottileStephen @ac360 as for AIG counterparties, they're responsible for their own counterparty risk. Break your bookie, don't collect.

@SottileStephen so Goldman isn't "entitled" to $17b just because they had contract with AIG. Only owed what they'd get in bankruptcy.

@mfriedri That's a preposterous question. Budget money is fungible. If states are non-paying ARCs, of course public salaries will be one...

2013-09-29 22:38:34
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/384447135238078464
@mfriedri ...set of expenditures. But those $s were expected. The issue is what else they paid for -- like tax breaks and devel. grants

2013-09-29 22:40:16
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/384447565154238465
@mfriedri the point is that pension contributions are mandated by law. Politicians that don't pay them are simply illegally borrowing.

2013-09-29 22:48:02
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/384449518374494208
@mfriedri Your question plays with semantics -- like when NY "borrowed" $6b from its pension fund ostensibly to make ARC payments in 2010

2013-09-29 22:49:07
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/384449791679537152
@mfriedri In reality it was the same as an earlier, rejected plan to borrow $6b from the fund to pay general budget obligations.

2013-09-29 22:49:57
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/384449999452770304
@mfriedri But Gov. Paterson thought it sounded better to say they were borrowing to keep up with pension payments.

2013-09-29 22:50:59
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/384450261559017472
@mfriedri Both plans accomplished the exact same thing -- borrowed money from the future to pay present budget obligations.

2013-09-30 01:58:54
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/384497551837515776
@mfriedri well, first of all, it's securities fraud and illegal to borrow from her. You're defrauding bondholders.

2013-09-30 02:00:17
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/384497900631625728
@mfriedri Secondly, they're not borrowing from her because it's the only way. It's because it's the easiest and most expedient.

2013-09-30 02:01:36
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/384498229603479552
@mfriedri Thirdly, there's a huge difference between borrowing from the fund and borrowing by non-contributing. The latter is way worse

2013-09-30 02:02:46
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/384498522894401536
@mfriedri by non-contributing, the fund doesn't appreciate assets year after year. Pensions are carefully projected based on regular cont's

2013-09-30 02:04:13
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/384498890747437056
@mfriedri @nathantankus high returns are far less important than regular contributions.

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426780586376957952
@EdgeofSports @ParkerMolloy @Grantland33 oh, he should have stopped working once he found out about her trans status. Not talking abt that.

2014-01-24 18:22:03
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426781960430964736
@ParkerMolloy @EdgeofSports Re deal only: All that matters is that she intended to use Hannan to disseminate untrue facts. That nixes deal.

@PhoinixArt @EdgeofSports @ParkerMolloy if source tells me she worked on Stealth Bomber and I learn it's not true, I HAVE to investigate why

2014-01-24 18:40:20
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426786561360162818
@PhoinixArt again, I agree that they made all-time inexcusable blunder in outing Dr. V. But you must look into it when your sources lie.

2014-01-24 18:42:13
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426787035844984832
@PhoinixArt @EdgeofSports @ParkerMolloy that might be true bt you have to find that out. Mistake was what they did with info, not getting it

2014-01-24 18:45:25
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426787842908762112
@1RadLibrarian @ParkerMolloy @EdgeofSports  now that's just silly. They were selling a product and had spread myths already that aired on TV

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426788222908497920
@PhoinixArt absolutely. Why not? You talk to everyone. That was normal: disclosing her trans status was not.

2014-01-24 18:48:52
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426788711544930304
@EdgeofSports @PhoinixArt @ParkerMolloy Agreed! but there are important ethical issues in this one.

2014-01-24 18:50:14
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426789052789297152
@PhoinixArt it's a problem for the investor, not the journalist.

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426789629808099328
@EdgeofSports @ParkerMolloy that's not at all what I'm saying. I'm saying Hannan had to find out why V was lying about resume only.

2014-01-24 18:53:22
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426789844149633024
@EdgeofSports @ParkerMolloy he should never have outed her to investor or anyone else. That info is totally off-limits once you learn it.

2014-01-24 18:54:54
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426790229148991488
@EdgeofSports @ParkerMolloy But (I'm repeating myself) he had no obligation to Dr V dealwise once he found out she wasn't DoD physicist etc

2014-01-24 18:56:04
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426790520069689344
@ParkerMolloy @EdgeofSports I totally agree with that. Should have dropped story, reached out and tried to help her.

2014-01-24 18:58:36
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426791158841638912
@PhoinixArt @EdgeofSports @ParkerMolloy yes, EXACTLY. Two things are totally unrelated.

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426793099504156672
@EdgeofSports @RobotCommission I can't repeat this enough: her gender identity wasn't a lie. Her resume deceptions are what nixed the deal.

2014-01-24 19:07:08
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426793308686655488
@EdgeofSports @RobotCommission in fact implying that her trans status was one in a series of lies was one of the major mistakes of the piece

2014-01-24 19:08:38
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426793685154791424
@EdgeofSports @RobotCommission but she lied to Hannan about smaller things, and that forced him to dig more.

2014-01-24 19:16:05
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426795561325699073
@younggreencard @EdgeofSports sigh. Again: he should not have outed her. Piece shouldn't have run. Trans issue is separate from "deal" issue

2014-01-24 19:19:06
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/426796319660060672

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/453952389364854784
@egatseos it's not a utilitarian question. It's a moral question. If others go to jail for lesser offenses, the HSBC offender must go, too.

2014-04-09 17:48:29
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/453952605232697344
@egatseos otherwise you are creating a justice system where the punishment depends upon the defendant's ability to pay.

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/530388021921976320
@mcurryfelidae07 This piece has a lot about Holder in it. Alayne came forward because of frustration over Holder's failures.

2014-11-06 15:57:20
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/530388473455603712
Alayne is a witness to old offenses but her story is also largely about Eric Holder and his failure to effectively punish the banks...

2014-11-06 15:58:23
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/530388737130512386
She was the central cooperator in the state's "$13 billion settlement" last year which hid details of bank wrongdoing...

2014-11-06 15:59:16
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/530388958577176576
She came forward after watching Holder conclude similar whitewashing deals with other banks. The story to me is about Holder's legacy.

2014-11-06 16:14:21
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/530392755730915328
A key detail is that Alayne was not interviewed by criminal investigators until late this summer, despite being their main cooperator.

2014-11-06 16:15:32

The DOJ may in fact be investigating now in some fashion, but what were they doing between the settlement and this August?

2014-12-14 01:32:22
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/543941534232875008
@1murman1 So the choke hold was totally incidental?

2014-12-14 01:35:16
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/543942262569598977
@1murman1 You don't understand either the law or the definition of homicide. You can have homicide without a crime. This was ruled homicide.

2014-12-14 01:39:11
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/543943248503640065
@1murman1 Says Pantaleo! The video clearly shows him wrapping an arm around EG's neck. The ME ruled this caused his death.

2014-12-14 01:41:16
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/543943773852815360
@1murman1 if I hit you on the head and you die of an aneurysm in the ambulance, it's the same thing: homicide.

2014-12-14 01:52:26
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/543946583914868736
@1murman1 I can't believe I'm seriously arguing with someone who believes EG died of "fatness" while police coincidentally assaulted him.

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/543949216436207616
@1murman1 It doesn't matter what his health situation was. If the arm pressure is the triggering/predicate act, it's homicide.

2014-12-14 02:06:11
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/543950046849671168
@1murman1 The grand jury agreed with you that the arrest was not criminal. The ME disagreed with you and ruled Pantaleo caused his death...

2014-12-14 05:35:48
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/544002795884789760
@1murman1 @TpaChristopher You don't have to show that at all. For the purposes of determining homicide or not, totally irrelevant.

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/544011891035897856
@1murman1 it's not important what it's called. What's important is that the city's doctor ruled it was the cause of death.

2014-12-14 06:13:37
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/544012313049972738
@1murman1 So your position is, the ME was wrong.

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/544013330302926848

In sports locker rooms, reporters always the lowest form of life in the room. In political pressers it's occasionally the other way around

@PruPaine @DavidJohnGarth I was not saying the error was not important in light of a larger issue, far from it. Just the opposite.

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547040555474366465
I was just saying that I personally skipped over the "Jackie" scene when I read the piece. I'm not saying it wasn't a huge mistake.

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547046081100783616
@Hendrew I wouldn't know how to write a campus rape story. I'm just saying that as a reader I didn't feel like reading a gang rape scene.

2014-12-22 21:04:12
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547135538244096000
@PruPaine So as a reader only, I was uninterested in the graphic rape scene &amp; skipped to the "story," which to me is about frequency/policy

2014-12-22 21:10:45
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547137187180183552
@PruPaine I did not take any position. I said the larger issue is how often rapes happen and how society is set up to deal with it.

2014-12-22 21:12:58
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547137744162791424
@PruPaine My point, which you seem determined to miss, was that as a reader, I was more interested in that than the description of a rape

2014-12-22 21:17:07
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547138790247395329
@PruPaine Yes, you would be wrong to infer that. How could you infer that? I've never said a thing on the topic.

2014-12-22 21:24:26
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547140632423440384
@PruPaine That's fine, but I've had nothing to do with that.

2014-12-22 21:26:07
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547141056761171968
@PruPaine Wemple's blog implied that I was saying the factual issues were insignificant in light of the larger issue. That's not right.

2014-12-22 21:29:02
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547141790730813440
@PruPaine To you it implies that. To me it just means I read it.

2014-12-22 21:31:40
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547142452818509824
@PruPaine Not in position to reject or accept anything. I haven't investigated the issue. Thats why I never say anything about it publicly

2014-12-22 21:42:03
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547145066595483648
@ErikWemple @PruPaine First of all, Imus prompted me by talking about how he was squeamish about reading violent scenes...

2014-12-22 21:42:54
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547145277170548739
@ErikWemple @PruPaine And that, not any mention of an "agenda," was what I was agreeing with.

2014-12-22 21:45:58
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547146048503050240
@ErikWemple @PruPaine I wasn't answering the same question Erdely was. I was saying: as a reader, the larger issue was more important to me

2014-12-22 21:53:30
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547147946270416896
@PruPaine What I actually said in the interview was that if skipped the violent part to read the more interesting part of the story...

2014-12-22 21:54:02
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547148079385034752
@PruPaine .. And then was shocked to find out later on that, "That turned out to be the crucial part of the story."

2014-12-22 21:54:55
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547148301557309440
@prupaine I would suggest you actually watch the interview. http://t.co/qpwjfVufHj

2014-12-22 21:56:16
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547148644169043968
@PruPaine So what you're responding to are excerpted remarks from a WaPo piece, not my actual thoughts, which were very offhand/noncomittal

2014-12-22 22:08:34
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547151739494096896
@ErikWemple You also left out the part where I said that the rape account "turned hit to be the crucial part of the story."

2014-12-22 22:13:57
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547153091863527426
@PruPaine I don't know how many ways to say it. I don't believe in telling lies to further a bigger agenda. It's the opposite of journalism

2014-12-22 22:20:35
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547154759879507968
@ErikWemple Except that by saying "That turned out to be the crucial part of the story," I'm saying the opposite of what Erdely said.

2014-12-22 22:21:44
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/547155050297327618
@ErikWemple I have people writing me now accusing me of saying the "larger issue" is more important than the mistake.

@bossy909 I'm rarely on Twitter. I come specifically to answer criticism. But this isn't criticism: it's unethical and he needs to apologize

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550922391652950016
@RaniaKhalek @bossy909 I have no problem with criticism of what I actually wrote. But I did not criticize BDB for saying. Black Lives Matter

2015-01-02 07:52:40
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550922611224760322
@RaniaKhalek @bossy909 I did not suggest BDB's Dante speech came after Liu/Ramos shootings.

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550923989909254144
@RaniaKhalek @bossy909 MB dishonestly wrote, declaring "I get why police are protesting,Taibbi criticized BDB saying Black Lives Matter"

2015-01-02 07:58:47
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550924148604956672
@RaniaKhalek @bossy909 This implied that I supported police protests in a clear and deliberate mischaracterization.

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550924360325033985
@RaniaKhalek @bossy909 He incorrectly suggested I'd said there is nothing to do about race so we should focus on tax collection.

2015-01-02 08:00:31
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550924586687401984
@RaniaKhalek @bossy909 In fact I simply said that an ongoing national disagreement about race was harder to fix than Broken Windows.

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550924962182488065
@RaniaKhalek @bossy909 Finally, he suggested I did not believe Eric Garner's death was a homicide. I wrote a lengthy piece raging otherwise.

2015-01-02 08:02:36
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550925108005855233

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550925469001187329
@RaniaKhalek @bossy909 That is too many errors to be accidental. He is deliberately mischaracterizing me as some kind of police apologist.

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550925915124162561
@RaniaKhalek @bossy909 The odd thing: I'd have welcomed a debate over things I did say. I did believe BDB's Dante speech was clumsy politics

2015-01-02 08:07:58
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550926460748570624
@RaniaKhalek @bossy909 All of this is in addition of course, to years of reporting critical of Broken Windows and criminal justice inequity

2015-01-02 08:09:52
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550926938718871552
@Marionmarooned @RaniaKhalek @bossy909 First: I said he clumsily personalized Garner case. I did not criticize his use of Black Lives Matter

2015-01-02 08:11:03
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550927234379575297
@Marionmarooned @RaniaKhalek @bossy909 And by clumsy I just meant he left himself open to media attacks that did in fact take place.

2015-01-02 08:12:00
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550927474746728448
@Marionmarooned @RaniaKhalek @bossy909 And I'm happy to discuss that. But not until MB admits I did not criticize use of Black Lives Matter

2015-01-02 08:13:23
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550927824950153216
@bossy909 Or support police protests in any way, or say racism shouldn't be addressed, or say Garner case wasn't murder

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550934487115509760

2015-01-02 08:43:35
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550935424177143808
@demicker  And that's fine. We disagree, but that's okay. Just don't say I supported police protests &amp; criticized use of Black Lives Matter.

@RaniaKhalek @bossy909 What part was criticism? The part where I said his remarks were "maximally uncontroversial?"

2015-01-02 08:59:06
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/550939329422692352

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/551006161517170688

@SeanErnst @jayrosen_nyu Because we always do that in the news? Would we have seen BTK's letters if he didn't murder? Bin Laden's fatwas?

@SeanErnst @jayrosen_nyu We constantly publish offensive and disgusting things in the name of informing the public.

@SeanErnst In the context of explaining why a newsworthy event happened, yes. Absolutely. We do it all the time.

@SeanErnst You've never seen the Westboro Baptist protesters on TV? We didn't censor that and shouldn't have.

2015-01-08 22:55:39
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/553324179375030272
@SeanErnst Because in this case the policy is a lie. There's no policy. They're just afraid of this particular group.

@nerditry That's true, but that just exposes the "policy": they're afraid of blowback/foreign staff being attacked. Understandable, but...

2015-01-08 23:02:38
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/553325939019755521
@nerditry Totally disingenuous to hide behind a "policy" that does not exist and never has.

2015-01-08 23:04:09
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/553326319287947264
All I'm saying is that the media has no qualms about publishing offensive material in other instances, if it's "newsworthy," which this is.

@SandraHelena39 @DashMan18 @chrislhayes You seem to be confusing approving of the images versus publishing. We publish/show almost all.

2015-01-22 12:49:37
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/558245096186212353
@Salon Obviously yes Eastwood was trying to show how Kyle's defiant incuriosity about his mission damaged him in the end...

2015-01-22 12:51:53
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/558245667408461824
@Salon But by failing to make that dilemma explicit, he left room for audiences to interpret that incuriosity as heroism. Which is happening

@aMichaelPhelps That study is silly. The common factor among the best teams are QBs who get rid of the ball quickly (Manning, Brady).

@root_e I did no such thing. My issue with Holder -- and Winston's -- is that they allowed BOA/Countrywide to settle w/o real punishment.

@root_e Yes, Winston's lawsuit was a state issue. But the non-prosecution of Mozilo and the 2014 BOA settlement were on the DOJ.

@NikoTheFarmer Two, if you think "obstructing pedestrian traffic" is actually a crime, you're nuts.

2015-05-26 19:31:43
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/603282385812201472
@NikoTheFarmer It's an obscure part of the disorderly conduct statute that was never designed to apply to people standing on street corners.

2015-05-26 19:33:07
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/603282734732201984
@NikoTheFarmer It's one of many offenses, like "obstructing government administration" or loitering, that are used as pretexts for detention

Asked: would he send FBI/National Guard to shut down abortion clinics, Huckabee says, "We'll see when I'm president." http://t.co/wSav4ZmgV6

Huckabee's argument is that the unborn are people and therefore entitled to die process and equal protection.

2015-07-30 23:17:32
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/626894423062740992
Huckabee said he would protect the unborn the way he would protect citizens "in an embassy in Benghazi" or "on the front lines of a war."

Turner, a mother of 8, was arrested for shoplifting crab legs. Police kept her in jail w/o bail because no judge was on duty to arraign her.

Efforts by @es_snipes and the rest of the Garner family were key to getting a special prosecutor to investigate such cases.

Also very noticeable: Judge Berman actually helped Kessler make a point by pointing out how useful Pash would have been as a witness.

2015-08-19 16:30:52
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/634039842188492801
It wasobvious by the questions that Berman is angling for a settlement based on Brady maybe admitting non-cooperation but no deflation.

2015-08-19 16:34:08
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/634040662065827840
Berman was miffed that the NFL wavered on whether Pash was co-lead investigator, pointing out NFL itself had announced this: (1/2):

2015-08-19 16:44:19
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/634043226320711681
(2/2) Berman to NFL re Pash as co-lead counsel: "It's not my press release. You all wrote it."

2015-08-19 16:46:26
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/634043756858220545
Berman also ripped NFL lawyer Nash for implying Brady "probably" had done this before.

2015-08-19 16:48:26
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/634044263127494656
Berman had a "bit of a problem" with saying "he probably had done this before," or "some guy from the Colts say they do this all the time."

2015-08-19 16:59:59
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/634047167213211648
Berman also dwelled a lot on what was "conspicuously absent" in the Wells report: finding that Brady engaged in scheme during AFC title game

2015-08-19 18:17:42
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/634066725445742592
I think it's reasonable to conclude that Berman may have been miffed with the NFL for not moving toward settlement. https://t.co/bTvfwZQ38F

2015-08-19 18:19:29
https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/634067175117090816
Another key moment came when Berman seemed to castigate Nash for inferring wrongdoing from Brady stating he preferred balls at 12.5 psi.

https://www.twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/704868664030457856
Trump was practically humping the lectern in that speech. That was as manic a power-high as you'll ever see on TV.
