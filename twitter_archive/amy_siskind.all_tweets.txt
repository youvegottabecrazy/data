If u listen to the media Hillary MUST win every state..MUST.
Bernie will be okay if he just wins any.
Someone get these folks a calculator!

2016-03-15 22:23:50
https://www.twitter.com/amy_siskind/status/709867731034701824
Actual math, away from media spin:
If Hillary wins 375 of the 691 delegates: Bernie would need 66% of ALL remaining states.

Looks like a thumping in FL -Hillary up big.

2016-03-15 23:41:09
https://www.twitter.com/amy_siskind/status/709887190613041157
Given:
FL is a landslide,
NC looking like a big margin
OH too close to call
we can already say, Hillary will win more delegates tonight.

Great! Why don't you skip and step -
1. take cash out of your bank account
2. put it in the toilet
3. flush https://t.co/IG7VpFdpqD

Jeff Weaver outspent Hilary's campaign by 2 to 1 (on mostly negative ads) in NY and lost by 16 points. That's throwing $$ down the toilet!

On days like today, it's so clear the @GOP isn't interested in protecting life. They're interested in controlling non-white men &amp; @NRA $$$!

A major takeaway of 2016 is that our great county is also among the most sexist of civilized nations - about the last to be led by a woman.

2016-12-27 23:10:10
https://www.twitter.com/amy_siskind/status/813884708786421762
2/ and that the left is just as sexist as the right. Let's face it folks. Brogressives are even more condescending and patronizing.

2016-12-27 23:10:45
https://www.twitter.com/amy_siskind/status/813884854127489025

https://www.twitter.com/amy_siskind/status/813885184202473472

2016-12-27 23:13:50
https://www.twitter.com/amy_siskind/status/813885630757404672
