Twitter Inc is cooperating with Kremlin to block accounts on the authorities' internet blacklist. No doubt it will include opposition soon.

2013-03-15 14:14:47
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/312567557779496961
It's a dark day for internet freedom when Twitter allows a repressive dictatorship to define which of its accounts and tweets are criminal.

2013-03-15 14:16:33
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/312568002312818688
Right now the Kremlin net blacklist uses pretext of 'drugs' or 'promoting suicide.' But we know from experience these laws are political.

2013-03-15 14:17:50
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/312568324460523520
So Twitter cooperating now, accepting the Kremlin's definition of prohibited activity, inevitably means opposition members will suffer.

By quality I refer to the level of the games, not the players. Under KO tension it is nearly impossible to play your best chess.

2013-08-11 14:43:18
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/366570524228321280
Beauty on the chessboard requires risk, and pressure of elimination works against taking risks. Exciting event, but rarely memorable chess.

2013-08-11 14:44:11
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/366570749873491968
But the world's best can create under any circumstances to be sure. So I am hoping for great chess as well as the usual emotion of the KO.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/367365076430225408
Struggling federations like Peru's cannot send a big staff of coaches &amp; aides. Difficult just to send players! But FIDE taxes them anyway.

2013-08-14 21:15:23
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/367756358344376320
And did Peru's federation say anything? They voted for Ilyumzhinov, the FIDE president, and what did they get? Are they now afraid to talk?

2013-08-14 21:16:41
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/367756688767467520

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/368485184930197505
I have no trouble with calling it a "rainbow" or "vodka" boycott, but cute names should not hide the many reasons Putin should be a pariah.

2013-08-16 21:33:26
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/368485677068849152

2013-08-16 21:34:22
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/368485911547219968

With a pawn on h2, Grischuk would have real chances. Down a pawn all his heroic efforts look doomed. He's fighting but it doesn't look good.

2013-08-18 18:35:20
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/369165635466440704
But Grischuk deserves credit for the energy he is putting in. He may get the f-pawn and then his fighting spirit may still be rewarded!

2013-08-18 18:37:06
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/369166079093796864
If Grischuk had shown 50% of this tenacity yesterday he wouldn't need it so much today! He lost game one with no chances, very odd.

2013-08-18 18:41:52
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/369167279600041985
I'm not sure the rook endgame would be winning but I can say it's the best position Grischuk has had and that is something!

2013-08-18 18:42:48
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/369167511377289217
On other games, Granda-Zuniga recovered from his horrible blunder yesterday to force tiebreak with Giri. More good karma for Peru!

2013-08-18 18:43:14
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/369167623700746240
Granda played well, but Giri looked like he was playing under guilt from winning a losing game yesterday, as if he owed Granda something.

2013-08-18 18:48:55
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/369169049978019840
I expect my countryman Grischuk can finish this off after his amazing comeback. We must applaud such effort! Now 109.Bh5 should be winning.

I don't know if Vachier-Lagrave is religious, but there was a miracle in his game in Tromso today! But the win for Kramnik was hard to find.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/372555482025574400

Kramnik had the same endgame against me in 2000 as he had today in against Vachier-Lagrave. Can you find the wins? https://t.co/sk5Blgi0Cp

Latest from the jails of Putin's Russia. Pussy Riot member Alekhina got 4 letters, prison burned them in a bucket for "subversive content."

To be clear, these were letters she received in prison! They said they were about "overthrowing the regime" and they burned them openly.

2013-08-28 07:50:57
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/372627347930763264
By the way, this is happening as Pussy Riot members Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova have had parole &amp; requests to do community service denied.

Now it is 2002 world junior champ (and 2012 Russian champ) Andreikin vs former world champion Kramnik in the 4-game final starting tomorrow.

2013-08-29 19:28:06
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/373165180818964480
Kramnik is obvious favorite but surprisingly Andreikin has a winning record against him with two wins &amp; no losses, both wins this year.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/373165838322266112

In a game of blitz chess, you may have only a few seconds per move. So calculation is very limited and patterns and intuition are paramount.

Kramnik's win in game 1 was a great effort. His doubled pawns helped him in the end. If the pawns are on f2-g3-h2, likely perpetual check.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/374073994447581184

If you are trapped in a room with a time bomb, you can hide in a corner and hope it doesn't kill you or try to defuse it, cover it, etc.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/384176287536791552

In chess we have a clock &amp; if you run out of time you lose, regardless of the position. In life, too, time too often overrules quality.

2013-10-01 22:21:21
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/385167578319949824
Getting into severe time pressure does not only lead to inferior decisions. It can also cause you to waste all of your previous work.

2013-10-01 22:23:01
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/385167999038017536
It has been shown that even after long deliberations &amp; research, when in time pressure we tend to decide impulsively, ignoring our work.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/385168726485528577
"I do my best thinking in time pressure" is a fallacy. 1) You can use your intuition before a crisis. 2) Calculation + intuition is best.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/385171843901960192

So decisions are usually best made in the middle of that normal distribution, benefitting from calculation and before too much pressure.

2013-10-01 22:55:32

Instinct comes in to tell you when a decision is critical and worth extra calculation time. Giving every decision extra time is weakness.

That is not to take a side in the "whistleblower vs traitor" argument, but his embrace of Putin's Russia was a dubious choice at best.

2013-10-02 05:31:46
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/385275897177067520
Saying Snowden had "no choice" but to take refuge in an oppressive dictatorship and pay his rent with praise for Putin is absurd.

2013-10-02 05:46:42
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/385279655273447424
As one who had a KGB "minder" for years &amp; was tracked like all opposition to Putin, I have little sympathy for govt surveillance power.

2013-10-02 05:48:27
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/385280095323029504
But Snowden's position was greatly weakened when he embraced Putin's Russia, a police state. It is a steep price for his freedom.

2013-10-02 05:51:18
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/385280810296680449
Does it not weaken Snowden's case for a moral stand against NSA powers when he turns around to compliment the record of a police state?

2013-10-02 05:53:22
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/385281333603229696
He is not "just living free". Snowden is buying that freedom by praising a KGB dictatorship and lending it his credibility. A high price.

2013-10-02 05:56:11
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/385282042591576064
Of course I am biased! Snowden is providing cover for Putin, who has turned my country back into a police state. NSA is a separate issue.

Still confused by those saying Snowden "had no choice." He chose to copy files &amp; share them. He chose to go to China, then to Russia.

2013-10-02 21:14:57
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/385513257143779329
Then Snowden made the one choice I care about most, to buy asylum in Russia by praising the repressive Putin regime. He chose to do that.

2013-10-02 21:18:03
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/385514036365758464
I respect the arguments over if Snowden is protected as whistleblower &amp; over the value of his leaks to society. But are separate topics.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/385515085180829696
Yes, I respect Ellsberg's opinion on it. But when Snowden hurt his own cause &amp; mine &amp; Russia's for self-preservation, no respect for that.

2013-10-02 21:29:45
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/385516981341798400
True, Snowden didn't stay &amp; face the law. To some it's another loss of credibility. But here I will not judge so easily. Law can be unjust.

2013-10-02 21:33:43
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/385517977933582336
In Putin's Russia defying laws of a corrupt dictatorship shouldn't be treated as simple criminality. US not the same, but keep it in mind.

The lack of protest says two things. 1) Everybody thinks Greenpeace activists are annoying. 2) Western leadership has no will vs Putin.

In Putin's Russia, when extremists &amp; nationalists riot against immigrants, the police go out and arrest immigrants. Always bash the weak.

Decision to suspend Navalny's sentence shows Kremlin fears him &amp; opposition. They want to keep threat over his head, keep him tied down.

2013-10-16 14:54:10
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/390490857574379520
Of course it is good news for Navalny &amp; his family that he is free. But still convicted, cannot run for office, can be jailed any time.

2013-10-16 14:56:14
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/390491380763484162
Putin always tries to bring threats into the system as "loyal opposition." Kremlin would love to adopt Navalny to maintain power structure.

2013-10-16 15:04:21
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/390493422257049600
Do not forget there are yet more ridiculous charges against Navalny, brought as a favor (?) to Kremlin by French company Yves Rocher.

2013-10-16 15:05:20
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/390493667951009793
It seems the Kremlin would rather have Navalny in courts for the rest of his life than marching in the street or in prison as a martyr.

This method gives the illusion of a functioning Russian justice system when it is little more than systematic harassment &amp; repression.

Navalny got 650,000 votes in Moscow &amp; is now banned from running for office. Kremlin wants him talking to courtroom walls, not the people.

2013-10-16 16:53:19
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/390520843387682816
Navalny could easily have won a council seat and that would have provided him with immunity from prosecution. Kremlin couldn't allow that.

A sure sign of bad strategy is when you cannot explain what will happen if your plans work. Define success first. Aim high but know why.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/390873928781942785
That was hammered into me by Botvinnik, the 6th world champion. Even if I suggested the right move, he demanded I explain why it was best.

It goes beyond "showing your work". Thinking about *why* it works helps you understand your own thought processes. Why were you right?

When you win, when your plans work &amp; your decisions pay off, the tendency is to assume you are a genius, that there is nothing to review.

Second, is the Dem "victory" a reflection of good policy &amp; good strategy for future, or just worse play by opponent with mutual blunders?

When the biggest tech firms are hiring more lawyers &amp; lobbyists than engineers &amp; looking at stock price not R&amp;D levels, it's very bad news.

I call this Herbert's Law: At a certain point a company's lawyer -to-engineer ratio indicates if it is innovating or just protecting turf.

World championship teams are always interesting. Some need creative types as seconds to provide opening ideas for the player to evaluate.

2013-11-08 17:50:44
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/398870214885900289
While other players are the idea generators and they need seconds and coaches who will evaluate them and limit the flights of fancy.

2013-11-08 17:54:20
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/398871119446282240
Of course it's true outside of chess, for any team leader. Do you want idea people, disciplined critics, a mix of both? Which type are you?

2013-11-08 17:55:42
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/398871464599764992
Running an effective team is an important part of world championship chess preparation. Matches are very short now but prep lasts months.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/398871817667895296
You can be surrounded by brilliant players on your team, but somebody has to say, "enough!" and move on to next job. Must prioritize.

2013-11-08 17:58:21
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/398872133310238720
Probably 95% of match preparation isn't used in the match, but work is never wasted. Even when it's not good, the effort makes you better.

Naming your seconds can be as much a ploy as not naming them. Can make your opponent wonder or worry, second-guess. @Bienpensant

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/398879349715107840
Naming them or not doesn't really affect much, of course. Just about anything can be interpreted as gamesmanship. Rarely true.

Hello from Goa! Great event today at #THiNK2013. Looks like half of those in attendance were tweeting about. I will share some in a moment.

2013-11-09 20:43:41
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/399276127425814529
First, a few brief comments on today's Carlsen-Anand game. Brief comments are fitting for such a brief game.

2013-11-09 20:45:03
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/399276471832694784
I imagine Anand's 2..g6 was a surprise for Magnus, and 4..c6 as well. Then White has a big choice: to play c4 &amp; sacrifice a pawn, or not.

2013-11-09 20:47:06
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/399276985177739264
Sacrificing the pawn with c4 would not be a typical position for Magnus but Anand (&amp; his second Leko) know those positions well.

2013-11-09 20:48:28
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/399277329970917377
But without c4 by White Black gets a very solid position, even if he plays the Nbd2 I'd prefer to Carlsen's Nc3. Little danger for Black.

2013-11-09 20:50:07
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/399277747899338752
I remember Anand played this in his 1994 NYC candidates match against Romanishin, who played c4 &amp; drew one &amp; lost one. Can be quite sharp.

2013-11-09 20:54:19
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/399278804650057728
First games of big matches are often tentative. Both get a half point but it's great to start any event with an easy draw with black!

2013-11-09 20:57:32
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/399279613613850625
Anand &amp; I drew first 8 games of our 1995 world championship match. But then, boom! Next 4/5 were decisive &amp; the match was basically over.

2013-11-09 20:58:44
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/399279914630672384
So do not get too depressed with a slow start. Of my 7 world championship matches, 5 started with draw in first game.

In my book, How Life Imitates Chess, I discuss evaluating things by 3 criteria of time, material, &amp; quality. Tal valued time over all.

2013-11-10 02:37:03
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/399365055159869440
A friend tried to summarize my "time, material, quality" theory by saying you have to balance "first, most, &amp; best". Must understand all 3.

2013-11-10 02:39:54
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/399365773451223040
It is similar to the saying that you can have something "done quickly, done cheaply, or done right. Pick two!" Sad reality of priorities.

I was mostly a 'time' player too, if not as much as Tal. RT @DmitriLiuBigD: @Kasparov63 Which did you think was the most important?

2013-11-10 03:11:42
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/399373772446121984
Having the initiative, controlling the tempo of the game, was my comfort zone. Quality also important; did not care much about material.

2013-11-10 03:15:50
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/399374814860697600
Ironically then, the concept of time is hardest to understand &amp; explain. Not to do with the clock, but with speed relative to environment.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400334059559067648
Carlsen got nothing in the opening. He wants calm positions but so far is getting calm &amp; slightly worse against Anand's strong reactions.

2013-11-12 18:48:59
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400334426518745088
That is, Anand is responding in way that offers either a sharp fight not to Carlsen's preferred style or calm with no advantage. Well done.

2013-11-12 18:50:32
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400334816794533888
Yes, was surprised to see Carlsen think after Vishy took with 3..dxc4. I'm sure Vishy took some confidence from that.

2013-11-12 18:52:28
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400335300099964928
There is a nice trap I saw if White tries a trick with 7.Nxe5? Bxe5 8.Bxc6+ bxc6 9.Qxc6+ Bd7 10.Qe4 f6 11.f4 Ne7! 12.fxe5 Bc6 Oops!

2013-11-12 18:54:19
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400335767995576320
Will know more tomorrow about match evaluation. Anand gets second white, warm-up time over! But clear as I said, no walkover for Magnus.

2013-11-12 18:56:38
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400336352358580224
So far like wrestling, with Magnus trying for a clinch &amp; slow squeeze &amp; Vishy handily fighting out of it but not pushing hard for more.

2013-11-12 18:58:58
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400336938286084096
Will be interesting to see if Magnus is content to keep circling like this or if he "takes the bait" &amp; plays a sharper line.

2013-11-12 19:00:17
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400337269212459008
No, no chance for anything 'great' yet, so don't blame players. But also, 'great' not always needed to win match &amp; that's what matters!

2013-11-12 19:01:42
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400337626504261632
Anand didn't play great vs Topalov or Gelfand but he beat them both! Vs Kramnik he was fantastic &amp; I'm sure Magnus is very aware of that.

It's far from exact comparison, but are parallels to 1st Petrosian-Spassky match, 1966. Petrosian champ but underdog. But only 8 yr gap.

2013-11-12 19:07:17
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400339031357018112
This is 3rd largest age gap in World Ch history, 22 years. Ironic it's young guy looking for quiet positions, veteran wants it sharp!

2013-11-12 19:10:04
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400339730362937344
Yes, both have same problem with white. How to balance desire for their type of position (sharp or quiet) vs objective quality of moves.

2013-11-12 19:11:01
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400339970675572736
So Vishy wants a sharp position but if Magnus defends well, how far out on a limb should Anand go? Carlsen can play sharply too!

2013-11-12 19:13:08
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400340504715350016
But that is all just talk &amp; what matters is preparation &amp; good moves &amp; high energy each game. Can't get too caught up in these clouds.

2013-11-12 19:16:30
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400341348542205952
Yes, I heard both players' answers to question about my visit &amp; was impressed by both. I do not want to be a distraction &amp; they are pros.

2013-11-12 19:17:41
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400341647910645760
No, as I have said over 100 times, I am not working with Magnus &amp; am here as a spectator. Not second, not commentator, not politician!

2013-11-12 19:20:38

Yes, "put your head into the tiger's mouth" is too strong. Anand doesn't need so much help! Perhaps "if you step into his lair" is better.

Game 4 also demonstrated exactly what I wrote for my last @chessinformant column: The Berlin is a sharp &amp; rich middlegame, not an ending.

2013-11-13 18:02:03
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400685000749617153
This was Kramnik's discovery, or re-discovery, vs me in 2000 that I didn't grasp. Nor did most others then. Berlin is more than a wall.

2013-11-13 18:03:15
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400685302391390208
After I lost to Kramnik &amp; failed vs his Berlin in 2000, many said it was still lousy, only good against me. Now every top player uses it!

2013-11-13 18:07:05
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/400686269782433793
No, my last column isn't out yet. I annotated Caruana-Adams &amp; wrote essay on Berlin. Nice coincidence! Will be in Informant 118 I think.

Tarrasch said, "before the endgame the gods have placed the middlegame." Sadly for Anand, in the endgame the gods have placed Carlsen!

2013-11-15 17:05:22
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/401395513766854656
A strange match but oddly balanced. Carlsen plays without openings and Anand without endgames! Statistically, that's in Magnus's favor.

2013-11-15 17:08:43
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/401396355999883264
Congratulations to Carlsen for his first world championship win. It took me 32 games! Surely not his last, but this match is far from over.

2013-11-15 17:17:55
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/401398669707976704
Again, is this objectively superior, no. And easy to make recommendations in hindsight of course! But looked more pragmatic vs Magnus.

2013-11-15 17:19:37
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/401399098005131265
Btw, Anand inspired the same sort of fear over the years. Players often try to avoid complications against his tactical talent.

2013-11-15 17:25:30
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/401400580481892352
As I see others suggesting, playing 39..g4 instead of sacrificing the pawn also looks superior. Though was likely still drawn as I said.

2013-11-15 17:27:28
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/401401074981928960
I was amazed at how quickly Magnus played 52.a4. He just *knows* these positions. It's very complex, a lesson in how to cut off king.

2013-11-15 17:28:35
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/401401354330984448
Yes, in my 1995 match with Anand he drew first blood and that got me fired up. If same true here it will be a great match! @Vishanth24

2013-11-15 17:30:49
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/401401918859132928
Anand is trying to play the best moves. What else? He is world champion! Hiding from equal endgame would be psychological blow. @GMjtis

2013-11-15 17:31:57
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/401402204705132544
But I had similar problem in 2000 when I lost my title to Kramnik. I played into his Berlin, his style, because I thought it was "best".

2013-11-15 17:33:30
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/401402592908943360
Situation not nearly as concrete for Anand, but yes, good to avoid long equal endgames vs much younger player who loves them! But how?

2013-11-15 17:35:59
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/401403219038830592
Anand crushed Kramnik by getting him into very sharp positions. Was very well prepared &amp; played great, but also much more at home there.

2013-11-15 17:37:00
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/401403472211214336
As I said after game 3, Carlsen content to wait patiently for 'his' positions, not trying to fight sharp opening preparation war.

2013-11-15 17:40:12
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/401404278515851264
Despite his gifts, no way for Carlsen to catch up to Anand's opening prep advantage. So, avoid it &amp; play to own strengths. Today it worked.

2013-11-15 17:42:51
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/401404944185438208
Similarly, it is unlikely Anand will fail to reach a few sharp positions of "his" preference. Then we'll see first big test for Magnus.

2013-11-15 17:48:39
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/401406403643858944
Without deeper analysis hard to say what "last mistake" was. Even 46..Re1 looks like it gives better drawing chances. Keep king active.

2013-11-15 17:51:14

After game 5, when someone told me Anand might play for a draw in next game, my answer was, "Maybe he will, but Magnus will not!" Fateful.

2013-11-17 13:58:14
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402073194435080192
It is impossible for the human mind to exclude previous events. Anand entered game 6 with heavy heart after loss &amp; Magnus smelled blood.

2013-11-17 14:01:23
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402073985594056704
The match is only half over, but Anand's problem is not just the score, but his play. Credit to Carlsen, but Anand has defended badly.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402075987543748608
Anything is still possible. Anand is a great player. But in chess, as in life, desperation leads to more losses than wins. Panic is fatal.

2013-11-17 14:12:38
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402076819462955008
There is a logical fallacy to over-emphasizing 'momentum' &amp; psychology. A player in a desperate situation usually already playing worse!

2013-11-17 23:44:53
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402220829024329730
Had a chance to look at game 6, but really not much to add to game 5 notes. Were nearly identical. Anand could not hold a drawn endgame.

2013-11-17 23:47:08
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402221396085858304
Unless Magnus gets nervous the match is over. Question is will he finish pragmatically like Karpov or like Fischer the maximalist?

2013-11-17 23:51:07
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402222399497580544
No doubt Carlsen will suffer some nerves as the end nears, it is unavoidable. But so far the quality difference at the board is too great.

2013-11-17 23:53:28
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402222989321568256
Carlsen is a combination of Karpov &amp; Fischer. He gets his positions &amp; then never lets go of that bulldog bite. Exhausting for opponents.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402436599771701249
What to say about game 7? Anand played like he's the one with a two game lead and an advantage in quiet positions. But that's Carlsen...

2013-11-18 14:03:38
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402436941364199424
Anand wanting to avoid a loss at all costs was understandable, since that would end the match completely. But now only two whites left.

2013-11-18 14:10:16
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402438609363410944
Winning with white requires playing very well, imposing your will. Winning with black always requires mistakes by your opponent.

2013-11-18 14:15:47
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402439998823088128
Trying to win with tiny advantage in quiet positions vs Carlsen is nearly impossible. Even objectively inferior chaos is better hope now.

2013-11-18 14:17:32
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402440439443124224
Of course there are discussions about two equal opponents and then this particular match and the players' form. Can't over-generalize.

2013-11-18 14:18:41
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402440728996900864
Superior preparation &amp; play can win with black, certainly. But when strong player is happy with draw with white, extreme risk required.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402441064776089600

Cambodian chess, Burmese, Thai, and a hybrid version of all called ASEAN Chess. Very interesting. I'll stick with my version though.

2013-11-18 16:28:37
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402473427560194049
One interesting rule in one is that pawns can only be promoted to original piece of that square. So rook pawns more valuable, etc.

2013-11-18 16:29:33
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402473662147596288
Also talked a lot about tech in chess &amp; how we have failed to live up to potential in social &amp; mobile. Chess is ideal for smartphones.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/402475490755096576
No, not really. Can't say about next games but clear Anand didn't want to fight today. You take on e3 with the pawn if you want to play.

2013-11-18 16:37:56

2013-11-21 15:17:44
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/403542753700614145
Anand knew keeping queens on was his best chance against Carlsen. But not three queens! He overdid it!

2013-11-21 15:25:53
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/403544803134021632
During Vishy long think on Qf4 you could see he was getting uncomfortable. ..b3 showed it wasn't easy, he started to get nervous.

2013-11-21 15:27:19
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/403545162913050624
He knew he had a good position and something must be there, but when no clear path his confidence dropped, concentration failed, blunder.

2013-11-21 15:31:52
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/403546308985647104
Anand rushed the attack, looking for concrete finish. Could have kept tension. 23.h4 Nc7 24.Qa3 is one example. 24.Qh4 also better than f6.

2013-11-21 15:34:05
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/403546866714828800
Maybe still a draw, but much harder to defend for a long time with many white threats. b3 pawn not so strong yet. 24.f6 was premature.

2013-11-21 15:35:28
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/403547217840988161
Yes, if Anand simply thought f6 was winning by force that explains, of course. But if so a very bad mistake after such a long think.

2013-11-21 15:37:00
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/403547602794201090
No, I didn't hear if Anand gave analysis in press conf. I assume during long think on Qf4 he got confused &amp; miscalculated. Did he miss ..b2?

2013-11-21 15:38:26
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/403547962925522944
Btw, I played this opening against Judit Polgar at Tilburg in 1997! I won with attack but Magnus played better. Her 10..h6 was very bad.

While commenting during the game here in Hong Kong, I thought 18.Rb2 prophylaxis was strong. Taking time, not rushing on kingside.

2013-11-21 15:58:06
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/403552910320996352
Even after ..b2 White had options. 27.Ne2 is interesting, adding to tension. ..Qa5 28.Nf4 Be6 29.Nxe6 fxe6 30.Bh3 but Black looks ok.

Amusing that Vishy wanted to keep queens on the board today and Carlsen won without ever moving his queen from d8! (Or bishop from c8.)

2013-11-21 16:06:22
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/403554990255374337

2013-11-22 06:20:39
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/403769980908343296
After thinking about Anand-Carlsen game 9 more on the plane, I'm more convinced that 26.Ne2 was last best winning chance for White.

2013-11-22 06:21:39
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/403770229542494208
Though as I said earlier, slowing black down on the queenside before continuing the kingside pawn advance was a strong idea. (18.Rb2)

2013-11-22 06:24:18
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/403770900182343680
The computers will soon grind the lines into dust, but 26.Ne2 keeps possibilities open, gives Black more chances to err under pressure.

2013-11-22 06:55:52
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/403778842482843648

Yes, Veslin Topalov, at Amsterdam 1995. http://t.co/DROmOYXiNU. But Magnus's pieces were even lazier, bishop also stayed home.

Dictatorships always push into open spaces. Obama was weak on Syria &amp; Russia so China &amp; Iran were quick to move. Not a coincidence.

That's 4 recessions in a row of recovery getting slower, starting with 1981. Others relatively predictable in shape. 90, 01, 07, very long.

21.Ne4+ is not a bad idea, but it loses to a back rank trick: 21..Bxe4 22.Qxf7 Qxb7! 23.Qxb7 Rab8 &amp; if queen moves, mate on b1!

2014-01-05 19:57:29
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/419920609426944000
And 21.Rxg6, also to remove protection of f7, is theme from the game too. But the rook on b7 is hanging. Just 21..Qxb7 and Black survives.

2014-01-05 19:58:22
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/419920832199008256
So instead of removing the bishop's protection from f7, just take on f7! 21.Qxf7!! and if 21..Bxf7 22.Ne4# is mate!

2014-01-05 20:01:01
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/419921498254479360
The back-rank tactic doesn't work for black anymore because the knight is still on g3 &amp; can block on f1. 21.Qxf7 Qxb7 22.Qxb7 Rab8 23.Qxg7.

Yes, this is problem with "engagement" of dictatorships by free world. Putin exploits the connections (Interpol, courts) &amp; cedes nothing.

Microsoft, Google, etc. giving data to FBI or Interpol is debatable. Require oversights, warrants, etc. But to give it to KGB?! To China?

This is why "cooperating on terror" is a joke. These are repressive regimes and that data will be used to persecute political dissidents.

Changing infamous KGB name made sense when USSR broke up. Were Putin honest he would have brought name back like he did its practices.

2014-01-15 21:58:47
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/423575012423921664
Putin could have brought KGB name back when they put the bust of infamous Cheka founder "Iron" Felix Dzerzhinsky back in Lubyanka in 2005.

Putin's persecution of gays in Russia is drawing more attention to his brutal regime. Good, but it is wrong to say this is a "values" issue.

2014-01-19 17:11:07
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/424952172434841600
Putin attacks gays for the same reason dictatorships throughout history have targeted vulnerable minorities. To scapegoat and distract.

2014-01-19 17:12:18
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/424952469236375552
Attacking LGBT is symbolic, yes, &amp; gay rights are human rights. The dictatorship is the problem, however, not Russian attitudes about gays.

2014-01-19 17:13:54
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/424952873105907712
Only in a distant sense, as the regime naturally targets those who are culturally most vulnerable: ethnic, religious, sexual minorities.

2014-01-19 17:17:27
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/424953764085104640
Most dictatorships, as Putin's, arise with popular support. But regimes w no feedback from the people lose touch, have no positive agenda.

2014-01-19 17:20:28
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/424954525032525824
So they go on the attack, ramping up propaganda &amp; scapegoating. Only agenda is negative.

Exactly, but so many people roll eyes if you say "Nazis". RT @kevinboyd1984: even the Nazis won parliamentary elections in 1932 and 1933

There is much to learn from how politicians &amp; media of US, UK, France, etc. treated Hitler in 1930s. When he wasn't the monster we know.

2014-01-19 17:59:48
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/424964423866777600
But if you try to make that point, no matter how reasoned &amp; accurate you are, even smart people say, "oh, you said "Hitler" so you lose."

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/424964875970805761

Don't just look at the Nazis with what we know now about what they eventually did. Look at them from contemporary reporting in early 30s.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/424967111362899970

NBC intro called the USSR "a pivotal experiment"! What can even be said? They must apologize to the many millions of Communism's victims.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/439525567084642305

Since you ask, no, Putin is no chess master. He is a good tactician playing against very weak opposition. He doesn't need strategy.

2014-03-04 16:36:26
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/440888509399052289
More important, Putin is one mind with one goal. His opponent is 20 squabbling leaders worried more about next elections than human rights.

2014-03-04 16:37:56
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/440888888203431937
This variant exists in chess, where masters take turns making moves in one exhibition game. The quality of play is always very low.

2014-03-04 16:39:10
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/440889195276824576
In foreign policy it's worse since there are no 'turns' (and no rules!). No unified voice &amp; all grabbing pieces trying to move at same time.

2014-03-04 16:40:15
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/440889471270420481
So Putin can make one threatening move &amp; watch the other side scramble into chaos. But if they find one good plan, he backs down.

True, Hillary's role in the "reset" humliation is a big strike against taking her seriously on Putin now. 4 years of wasted "engagement".

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/441081668733263872

Without such sanctions, Putin will win a big victory if he stays in Crimea or leaves it as "autonomous" part of Ukraine loyal to Kremlin.

The Budapest Memo isn't the same as a mutual defense treaty or NATO. But with Russia openly shredding it, co-signers UK &amp; US must act.

Don't ask about "consequences of inaction" on Ukraine when it is partly consequence of inaction in Syria. Inaction means always a next time.

Russian media incredible now. Heroic Putin "saving" Crimea "without firing a shot." Google that phrase. Krushchev to US &amp; Hitler in Austria.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/442164410623475712
Ugly to talk about already, but if Putin continues without opposition, real risk of ethnic cleansing in Crimea. 42% non-Russians there.

Putin believes that there's no need to fight the West militarily because you can just buy them. Cynical, but so far looks like he's right.

Tomorrow I'll post a story about how UK gave tons of Czech gold to Hitler in 1939. Little known today. Was banks to buy tanks in that case.

2014-03-08 05:22:41
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/442168503593091073
The discussion of that event in Parliament was even more amazing. Majority defended the banking interests of London over funding the Nazis.

2014-03-08 05:24:08
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/442168868463984640
Bank in UK sent gold Czechs had tried to keep away from Hitler after Nazis invaded &amp; forced transfer request literally at gunpoint. True.

I lived through ethnic pogroms in former USSR &amp; fled them with my family. Are tensions all over, Crimea too. Bad if Putin encourages them.

He can't go "save" the 58% Russians in Crimea without "saving" the 42% non-Russians. How will they feel about being under Putin suddenly?

2014-03-08 05:45:40
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/442174288930820096
In Feb, only 41% of Crimeans wanted to join Russia. Not even all the Russians there find it attractive.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/442174553775939584
But "ethnic cleansing" does not mean murder, or only murder. Could be deportation, etc. Many will surely feel great pressure to leave.

No, I advocate principles more than policy, which should be left for politicians who know more. But I am always happy to make suggestions!

2014-03-08 21:06:36
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/442406049220685824
1) Treat Putin's Russia like the rogue state it is. Remove from international institutions he exploits &amp; abuses. G-7, Interpol, WTO, et al.

2014-03-08 21:07:37
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/442406307342344193
2) Target Putin's ally oligarchs &amp; state companies with investigations &amp; sanctions as appropriate for the criminal enterprises they are.

2014-03-08 21:08:40
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/442406571755458561
3) Support the nations &amp; institutions Putin is trying to dominate &amp; destroy before they collapse. Ounce of prevention worth pound of cure.

2014-03-08 21:10:53
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/442407129857925120
4) Like a disruptive tech company, take the list of "what free world needs from Putin" &amp; create substitutions. Energy, supply lines, etc.

2014-03-08 21:13:30
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/442407787176665088
5) Support, not blame the victims. It wasn't Georgia's fault it wanted to join NATO. Wasn't Ukraine's fault didn't want to be Putin's slave.

2014-03-08 21:14:44
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/442408098964451328
6) This is rhetorical not an action item, but it's critical: Distinguish Putin from Russia. He's a dictator. Russian people don't want war.

2014-03-08 21:16:30
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/442408540784033793
A free, strong, &amp; democratic Russia will be a complex world power. But it will not be an enemy of the West or ally of dictators like now.

I was kid dreaming to champ in 72. Of course we rooted for Spassky against Fischer but many of us quietly admired his chess &amp; his attitude.

2014-03-10 22:40:04
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/443154346780680192
No, I can't say Fischer was a chess idol like that. His style was very different from mine. But of course I devoured his games &amp; analysis.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/443156108132499456
People forget that when I won world champ in 85 Fischer was only 42! Almost exactly same age as me when I retired still #1 in 2005.

2014-03-10 22:47:58
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/443156336042582016
So no doubt Fischer could have still been at the top. But that assumes the demons that drove him from chess would have been gone for good.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/443568654257750016

The EU has more, but the US also has 'vital interests' in protecting Ukraine. An unchecked Putin is bad for global stability.

2014-03-15 04:03:31
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/444685297704775680
As world's largest economy, military, &amp; energy consumer, US has vested interest in stability. Russia benefits from instability, oil $ rises.

Forcing the oligarchs &amp; their quasi-criminal state-run &amp; state-aided companies to move their money is the point! Chase it, scare them!

2014-03-15 04:06:17
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/444685993346887680
They are loyal to Putin because he has intl standing to protect their money. G-8 photo ops, big summits. No more. Rogue nation, kaput.

Russian oligarchs enjoy living in the West. They don't have to keep looking over their shoulder, wondering if they might be out of favor.

2014-03-15 04:08:45
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/444686615508959232
They also don't want to be in Russia during the inevitable collapse of the Putin regime. They will all turn on each other in a second.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/444687121526587392
Most of the oligarchs have tried to hedge their bets in case they have to run for it. Cutting off that escape route is a brutal threat.

2014-03-15 04:11:33
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/444687317543165952
Then they see they will be stuck in Russia when the files are opened, the looting exposed, as it always is. It's why Yanukovych ran for it.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/444688764225744896
Putin had to look tough after Yanukovych was kicked out. He assumed West would again fail to unite, not have political will to push back.

2014-03-15 04:18:22
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/444689033202253825
If Putin was wrong, if his latest bluff is called by strong sanctions &amp; isolation, then yes, he could be in trouble.

2014-03-15 22:13:07
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/444959504565022720
When it is the dictator's years of destroying mainstream opposition that empowers radicals in the first place. Self-fulfilling.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/444959881846865920

2014-03-15 22:16:14
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/444960289692585985

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/446764741659471872

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/446765270871601153

Putin may still invade eastern Ukraine; why not if West doesn't stand up for Crimea? But he may also just wait, as after Georgia.

2014-03-29 19:17:02
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/449988619798052864

To stay in power, dictators need to crack down harder, take bigger risks abroad, do things that make the regime more fragile in long run.

Attacking neighbors and cranking up propaganda can rally nationalistic fever for a time. But isolation &amp; repression rot the nation &amp; regime.

It's not Putin who cares about plausible deniability of Russian forces in Ukraine. He doesn't care who knows. EU &amp; Obama are ones in denial.

"Impervious to logic of reason, and is highly sensitive to logic of force." Famous 1946 "Long Telegram" on USSR, applies to Putin perfectly.

2014-04-19 21:17:01
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/457628962437341184

It's the supposed leaders of the free world who are in state of denial of Putin's war on Ukraine. They want to ignore it, so Putin keeps on.

2014-08-27 15:19:18
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/504649364107952128
Putin is in Ukraine because he needs war &amp; propaganda machine to rally support at home, to distract from bad economy &amp; dead civil society.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/504649897866711040

Maybe I like the easy life, but 15.Nd5 was the obvious move for Caruana. So many natural moves &amp; nowhere to play for Black. Now what, ..a3!?

17.h4! from Caruana, I like it. Black's pieces are distracted, time to go for the king. His instincts are in tune. If ..h5 g4! and a fight!

..Bc6 looks odd, could be serious trouble for Magnus now. Or his knight could land on b2 and he will draw &amp; confirm ..a5-a4-a3 is genius :-)

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/507644657556533248
Did Caruana really castle? Wow. King is great on e2, put rook on g-file, nearly winning. White still better, but strange.

Every time the West backs down vs Putin, every time he bluffs successfully, he gains more support at home, more momentum to take risks.

"High-energy objects"! They compete with Obama's administration for weak euphemisms to avoid saying what everyone already knows.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/509759580063006720
I agree w Sestanovich Obama is "tongue-tied" on foreign policy but I don't think it's mystery. Obama is a campaigner, not a statesman.

2014-09-10 17:46:36
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/509759862989787136
A statesman sometimes has to make unpopular decisions for the good of the nation. Obama has one eye on Putin &amp; ISIS &amp; the other on midterms.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/510095157065048064
As I said months ago, others who depend on US shield now see that only their own forces (even nukes) offer protection. Very dangerous.

2014-09-11 16:20:55
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/510100686353084416
I didn't say more nukes would be good. The opposite. Point is Putin already has them &amp; is always encouraged when other side looks very weak.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/510102686302085120

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/510103562597060609
It's another reason Putin's turn toward fascist ideology now is so dangerous. Before was just to make money, no ideology beyond power.

But not picking on any one industry. It's a cultural shift away from values of risk &amp; long-term toward safety &amp; short-term. No quick fix.

A "credible threat" means one of sufficient strength to deter Putin, not just punish him slowly for crimes already committed.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/518798176011440130

Approval is a dangerous sentiment, contrary to real leadership. It means taking the next poll more seriously than the future of the country.

Many in the West talk about "golden days" that never really were. In ex-Iron Curtain nations they remember bad old days that were very real.

2014-10-06 18:40:04
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/519195401744683008
The problem is when propaganda regimes like Putin's use the bad old days as a threat to stop any reforms, any change, with fear-mongering.

2014-10-06 18:52:06
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/519198429135003648

With $100+ oil, Putin could loot treasury and still fund the growing police state, foreign invasions, pensions &amp; patronage. Not anymore.

As oil-funded 'stability for freedoms" swap evaporates, Putin turns to other typical ways for dictators to preserve power. War, ideology.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/523155516474683392
It's a preposterous situation. Putin only wants persecuted Ablyazov as a chip in his disputes with Nazerbaev. He's the Kazakh Khodorkovsky.

2014-10-17 16:58:36
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/523156130982133760
Ablyazov is a recognized political prisoner. Will French justice really hand him over to Putin? Would be a disgrace. More "engagement"!

Germany, &amp; many other nations, is desperate to get back to business as usual with Putin. Too much MH17 blood on his hands is inconvenient.

2014-10-20 15:13:33
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/524216858023845888
The terrorists in Eastern Ukraine denied it, saying they aren't capable of using such a sophisticated system. For once I believe them!

2014-10-20 15:16:25
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/524217582904410112
I'm curious how Germans know it was a stolen weapon &amp; not one provided by Putin. Location? Not hard to put Russian weapons on UKR base!

2014-10-20 15:18:34
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/524218123843825664
Of course Putin would still be responsible for this war &amp; for MH17, but saying murder weapon was stolen gives West some cover to excuse him.

2014-10-20 15:19:53
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/524218451985182720
Remember, many appeasers in the West have been as desperate as Putin to pretend this is an internal Ukrainian problem, to ignore it.

2014-10-20 15:21:33
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/524218873051361280
Putin has benefited most from the MH17 murders. It paused the conflict when his forces were losing, giving time to consolidate, negotiate.

2014-10-20 15:22:25
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/524219091411021824
Many assumed at the time was Putin would be forced to cut off support after MH17. (I said he wouldn't.) Opposite happened. He doubled down.

2014-10-20 15:23:15
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/524219302208344064
Even while Putin's pet terrorists let the bodies of innocents from MH17 rot in the fields, West looked for excuses not to blame him.

2014-10-20 15:26:01
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/524219998039179264
At very least, Germans must provide evidence it wasn't Putin-supplied weapon &amp; crew. Evidence it was is strong: https://t.co/AygztlAdI2

@Outis6 Putin doesn't want to blitz, he could if he wanted. He wants to destabilize &amp; allow West to do little, pretend it's internal.

2014-10-20 15:29:23
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/524220843329454080
Why mention source of the weapon not being RUS, without providing proof, if not as a favor to Putin? Winter is coming, gas is precious..

2014-10-20 15:30:28
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/524221116403830785

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/524222348442886145
If Germany &amp; West admit Putin supplied MH17 weapon &amp; crew - as evidence says - no choice but to finally admit he is a terrorist himself.

2014-10-20 15:37:42
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/524222935960023040
So real question is, if US or Germany had satellite or comms proof of Putin's weapons &amp; forces shooting down MH17, would they admit it?

2014-10-20 15:38:24
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/524223114389884928
Considering how desperate they are to return to pointless negotiations with Putin, to buy his gas &amp; oil, &amp; to pretend he's not a threat?

Watching all the presentations at the #OsloFF exposes the attempts by dictators everywhere to create a mythology to justify their regimes.

2014-10-22 22:06:06
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/525045455441235968
Each dictator tries to say the circumstances necessitating his repression are unique to time &amp; place, that there is no alternative.

2014-10-22 22:07:15
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/525045746303635457
But the #OsloFF makes clear all dictators have much in common, always centered on denying the humanity &amp; free will of their people.

2014-10-22 22:09:24
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/525046289369530369
Apologists in West often use the same disgusting arguments, that certain peoples or nations don't want or are incapable of democracy.

2014-10-22 22:10:35
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/525046587358052353
This would mean those people are less than human. In fact, #OsloFF also shows how everyone wants the freedom to express their humanity.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/525047567369768960

Anyone simply discarding the possibility of Russian state meddling in the Carlsen-Anand match must be ignorant of both FIDE &amp; Putin regime.

2014-10-24 19:23:19
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/525729267070423040
Dictatorships operate under theory that anything that can be controlled must be controlled. If they see opportunity to interfere, why not?

2014-10-24 19:24:57
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/525729677349236737
Ilyumzhinov's FIDE has proved many times over it has no respect for rules or the players, and that it sees Carlsen as an alien, a threat.

2014-10-24 19:26:49
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/525730145915916290
It has also been made clear that the Russian Federation controls FIDE &amp; that Putin's govt has taken a direct interest in exploiting FIDE.

2014-10-24 19:28:21
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/525730534455246848
So Carlsen's team being anything other than "paranoid" about preventing any sabotage or influence in Putin's Sochi would be foolhardy.

2014-10-24 19:29:56
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/525730931873550336
I point all of this out not to create any scandal beyond the scandals of corruption &amp; repression that already exist in FIDE and Russia!

2014-10-24 19:33:56
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/525731937868992514
No, it's simple. Russia finds FIDE useful &amp; invested many state resources in retaining its control. Carlsen threatens FIDE's authority.

I'll relay one to see how you do with one of the great questions of philosophy &amp; cognition: What is intuition? In practice, not dictionary!

2014-10-28 16:29:07
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/527134978316840960
Of course intuition is a combination of experience &amp; emotion. But in practice, to me, it's what tells you *when* to make a decision.

2014-10-28 16:31:50
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/527135664643403777
Why do you decide on something -- a chess move, an order in a restaurant, to buy a house - in 5 minutes or 10? What says, "now"? Intuition.

2014-10-28 16:34:33
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/527136345085329408
That's why intuition is human &amp; unique, the emotional element. Not just data, but one's decision-making style. Impulsive, cautious, etc.

2014-10-28 16:36:34
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/527136856555528192
This isn't to say intuition is always right at all. As Kahneman &amp; Tversky proved, our best decision-making instincts are often very wrong.

2014-10-28 16:37:45
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/527137152644046848
But I do believe that the more we trust our intuition it's like a muscle that gets stronger &amp; more accurate. It's a human software upgrade.

From 2000-13 Putin's survival required being on good business terms with the West. But with nothing left to steal a dictator needs enemies.

2014-10-31 03:11:03
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/528021304331354112
So Putin simply flipped it over. After a decade of looting &amp; repression with no ideology or much aggression, his survival now requires both.

2014-10-31 03:13:33
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/528021933254656001
Putin hasn't changed, he just does what is necessary to survive like any dictator. Now that's war, nationalism, ideology. The last phase.

2014-10-31 03:15:45
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/528022487724879872
Even high oil couldn't sustain the economy vs corruption &amp; incompetence of Putin's regime. His "security for freedoms" tradeoff was broken.

2014-10-31 03:17:30
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/528022927090798593
So Putin had to radicalize to rally supporters, to attack minorities, internal &amp; external "enemies," and finally, a real war in Ukraine.

Amazing double blunder in #CarlsenAnand today. Blunders are not that unusual in world championship matches, but returning the favor is!

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/533662700208152577
Every time there is a bad blunder in a WCh game it's called "the blunder of the century" but the stress &amp; tension lead to mistakes.

2014-11-15 16:51:31
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/533663600347734018
eg Karpov missing 23.Qxd7 in g11 of our 1985 match. Terrible blunder but not unique. In my book on that match I listed a few others as bad!

2014-11-15 16:52:52
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/533663937565564928
It's even harder to understand Anand's opening choice today than the blunders. I looked at this line for my match vs Kramnik in 2000. Bad.

2014-11-15 16:56:36
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/533664876431175680
I remember looking at Bf4 and this h-pawn push and it's miserable for Black. Especially against Magnus, bizarre blunder today aside.

He's human. We know when we are losing &amp; it is hard to look for wins. RT @ssr99: @Kasparov63 How did Anand surrender such an advantage ?

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/533675913243029504
Today's is surely a candidate for "worst WCh blunder ever" because of giant eval flip. From huge advantage to probably losing in one move.

Carlsen has a lead and only 3 games to go. But if he starts to believe he can coast to the title it is very dangerous psychologically.

This is true with any stressful decision. You just want it to be over, to feel relief, and it can overwhelm all your critical thinking.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/536604552880226305
It was very good preparation by Anand (or Kramnik?!) with ..Be6, ..g5. And 23..b5 was great move. Carlsen's Kf3-e4 idea was brilliant.

2014-11-23 19:39:20
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/536604933857218560
And Nh5, f4 were also very strong moves. Carlsen played very well, not easy when dealing with nerves in a decisive game.

2014-11-23 19:41:08
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/536605387764797440
It was more or less as expected. Carlsen is stronger &amp; more stable. Anand better in deep prep but mostly unable to get there or finish.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/536606408964571136
As I wrote in my Informant column last year in Caruana-Adams, the Berlin is not an endgame at all. It's a sharp middlegame without queens.

2014-11-23 19:49:10

Obama says no new sanctions on Russia without Europe first?! More leading from behind! Putin won't change his mind, but his followers might.

2014-12-12 14:03:28
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/543405780624736256
As long as Putin's elites think they're better of with him than against him, nothing much will change. So far it's an easy choice for them.

2014-12-12 14:05:29
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/543406286428454912
So far Putin's oligarchs believe they can wait things out, that EU &amp; Obama don't have the will. Obama's statement will reassure them.

Take some time to reflect on the amazing life, words, and deeds of Andrei Sakharov on the 25th anniversary of his death. A great moral icon.

2014-12-14 21:11:36
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/544238298332692480
I do not believe it is so hard to know what is right, but few have the will and courage to do it, no matter how difficult, as Sakharov did.

2014-12-14 21:13:39
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/544238814160756736
Of Sakharov's many essential statements, one that echoes now is that the most moral policies always turn out to also be the most effective.

2014-12-14 21:19:45
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/544240349880012800
Sakharov's words rebuke the cowards &amp; appeasers he called "shortsighted pragmatists," who cut moral corners &amp; make deals with dictators.

2014-12-14 21:24:24
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/544241518698323968
"We must fight against injustice &amp; the violation of human rights for each individual person separately. Much of our future depends on this."

2014-12-14 21:25:40
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/544241836731412480
That is from Sakharov's 1975 Nobel Lecture. He also listed dozens of fellow Soviet political prisoners, "who share this honor with me."

2014-12-14 21:39:34
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/544245338455179264
I wished to give recommendations about Sakharov materials but see little in print or ebook, a great shame. His Memoirs are essential.

2014-12-14 21:41:34
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/544245837992583168
I am a free market supporter to the end, but it is sad that such essential works as Sakharov are out of print &amp; so much junk at bookstores!

2014-12-14 21:43:54

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/544253275215003649
It is also good to recall Sakharov the physicist who reminded us not to fear innovation &amp; to keep moving forward. http://t.co/kyapqL8jUY

2014-12-14 22:17:21
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/544254844891312129
It was during big growth of the global environmental movement &amp; Sakharov saw the danger of going too far &amp; fearing needed tech progress.

2014-12-14 22:19:51
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/544255474657689602
Sakharov could feel the value shift away from exploration &amp; risk toward safety and security and fixing the old instead of making the new.

2014-12-14 22:21:38
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/544255922391232514

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/545071589554130944

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/545072283740823552
Russia &amp; the ruble are so vulnerable to oil drop due to Putin turning the country into a corrupt petro-state. All eggs in one basket.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/545574012781617152
Putin thinks a grand bargain with US is still possible. Obama's Cuba move &amp; delay in signing Ukraine Freedom Support Act give him more hope.

2014-12-18 13:43:36
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/545575108807766016
Most of Putin's answers were deflections or he just ignored them to ramble about bears &amp; peasants. Disdain &amp; denial about Ukraine invasion.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/545575642776215552

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/571434746330415105
Boris's quality no longer fit Putin's Russia. He always believed Russia could change from inside without violence; after 2012 I disagreed.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/571435202385473536

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/577498527149998080

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/578992760264339456
Zweig &amp; Nabokov are both guilty of propagating the myth of the crazy chess master in their works. Made for good stories, but bad for game.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/579762609509044224

Hillary Clinton's problem isn't her logo. It's how to distance herself from catastrophic Obama foreign policy she helped build as Sec State.

2015-04-12 20:50:24
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/587357117599899648
The "ordinary Americans" Clinton talks about must remind her that they care about America's place in the world, freedom, &amp; about being safe.

2015-04-12 20:51:33
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/587357409125015552
Clinton either has to defend her lousy record or admit to many mistakes and run against nearly all of Obama's current foreign policies.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/587357952950009857
She can't be allowed to have it both ways, going hawkish while avoiding criticizing Obama's admin on Israel, Iran, Russia, etc.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/587359203079127042
Clinton is not to be underestimated. She is more hawkish than Obama. If she admits their mistakes, esp on Russia, she willl be formidable.

2015-04-12 20:59:53
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/587359507891761153

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/615209571821481985
Confidence is a big part of chess, especially for an attacker like Topalov. His lucky first round win on time vs Magnus changed whole event.

2015-06-28 17:27:02
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/615209807830732800
When an aggressive and speculative player like Topalov believes he has fate on his side, he is unstoppable! And Magnus went other direction.

In chess, as in other areas of life such as art and business, technology still requires and rewards human creativity instead of stifling it.

Seeing yesterday's King's Indian and hearing Yasser's voice reminded me of him cheering me on when I played a rare white in a KID!

The King's Indian splits GMs in a religious way. Many (like Yasser) believe it's unsound. Maybe so, but it's hard to prove at the board!

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/638029949413257216
Our game in Barcelona 1989 was one of the few times I played the KID w white &amp; maybe the only time Yasser did with black! (A nervous draw.)

A few months later we were back on our "home" sides of a King's Indian in Skelleftea in an incredibly complicated game that was also a draw.

One-man dictatorships don’t follow rules or listen to a parliament. Can act quickly, tactically. But no long term strategy, only survival.

2015-11-01 14:33:51
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/660827095992557568
Democratic world’s strength is institutions, stable and interconnected. When they are weakened and not defended, no strategy works.

Russia &amp; other former Soviet Bloc nations did this with the Communists as boogeymen. And many of us fell for it, myself included.

Putin/Iran/Assad plan in Syria is to wipe out all non-ISIS opponents &amp; then tell West, "You want Assad or ISIS, that's all that's left."

2015-11-01 16:19:52
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/660853772965531648
You can't look like a tough dictator without a big enemy. Assad, Iran, Putin happy to build up ISIS, even help them as they have lately.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/660854606579245062
Dictators create a political desert that is drier the longer they stay in power. And what survives in a desert? Snakes, rats, scorpions.

2015-11-01 16:25:50
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/660855277764411393
So what comes after Putin is likely bad &amp; gets worse every day he's around. That's why he still must go, despite risks. Price going up.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/661639833450913792
It's good to call out bias or influence, but it's not the same as jailing the publisher &amp; firing the staff for criticizing the president!

Distinguishing Russian national interests from its dictator's interests is essential to dealing with Putin. "Bad for Russia" is irrelevant.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/662074972744114176

Question is if Burma elections are decoration only, as in Russia &amp; many other dictatorships, or have actual power. https://t.co/kBsd2U4hQz

2015-11-08 17:44:49
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/663411868145475584
Even the worst dictatorships feel obliged to go through democratic motions to distract people from reality. Shows power of democratic idea.

2015-11-08 17:46:22
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/663412256235982848
But if the elections are a charade, giving them attention is a terrible mistake. Don't provide democratic credentials to thugs.

2015-11-08 17:47:42
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/663412593072164865
I always said this about Putin. Don't help him by pretending he is a democrat. But western leaders lined up to congratulate his "elections".

If you are so popular, why crush free media? Why ban opposition &amp; rig elections? Why jail critics? Putin can't answer. No dictator can.

Turkey is good enough for now for Putin since it's a NATO country, but eventually he'll have to blame the US, as in Ukraine &amp; Syria.

In 1946, Churchill predicted &amp; Truman fulfilled the need for an entirely new institutional structure to contain &amp; deter Stalin &amp; Communism.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/706267324916043776
As I describe in Winter is Coming, one of the great failures at the end of the Cold War was to recognize that a similar reform was needed.

The UN did become Churchill's "cockpit in a Tower of Babel," stagnant &amp; weak. But it froze superpower conflict. In 1991, that was obsolete.

I have a long op-ed in the NY Daily News tomorrow, Sunday. It's on one of my favorite topics: values, and someone without them: Trump!

Hacking &amp; hooligans are the least of it. Putin's network supports Brexit, for example. Funds far-right groups in EU, supports Trump in US.

Laws in Putin's Russia are a distraction from the more brutal reality. Civil society is dead; laws are last rites. https://t.co/HZ5GqEx33M

Arguing about laws instead of reality also allows useful Kremlin tools to criticize their masters &amp; maintain shreds of legitimacy in West.

Even if Putin puts on his "good tsar" hat and says laws are too extreme, pretends criticism matters, the brutal reality will not change.

2016-07-08 16:07:23
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/751447599387906048
It is always useful to Putin &amp; his Western appeasers to legitimize the Kremlin's pet "critics" and maintain tiny illusion of moderation.

If you need help explaining to your kids that your president is bad guy and that opposing him is patriotic, I have some experience...

2016-11-09 06:17:06
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/796235145665777664
Tell them that power doesn't make someone right. That there are moral laws to fight for that are more important than the leader or his laws.

2016-11-09 06:23:02
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/796236636606570496
And if your kids hear you criticizing the president, say that it is your right and your duty to disagree and fight for what you believe in.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/796239057294688258
And if your kids see you carried away by police, tell them about Gandhi, about Martin Luther King Jr, about Andrei Sakharov. Teach freedom.

I'll write more about Zakaria's documentary on Putin with more space later, but a couple of quick observations on how "powerful" Putin is.

2017-03-14 22:04:56
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/841772159194263553
Putin would always have the power of dictator with a huge nuclear arsenal. Total control, no checks or balances, thousands of nukes.

2017-03-14 22:07:20
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/841772762293256193
So Zakaria must mean impact, not raw power. And the influence Putin has now has been willingly conceded to him for a decade of complacency.

2017-03-14 22:09:08
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/841773213596147713
Calling Putin popular &amp; powerful when his support is shallow &amp; conditional. Nobody is going to die for Putin the way they died for Stalin.

2017-03-14 22:11:04
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/841773703352455169
Calling Putin "fiscally conservative" is even more absurd. He's a kleptocrat, a thief looting the nation for himself &amp; cronies.

2017-03-14 22:12:28
https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/841774054583500800
Describing Putin in normal democratic political terms legitimizes him. Popular, conservative, etc. He's a dictator, and a murderous one.

https://www.twitter.com/kasparov63/status/841776299123314688
