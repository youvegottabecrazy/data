2009-11-20 18:39:29
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/5896835401
@Carlosvj81 it can easily convince economically dependent countries (like Japan) to break ties with the U.S.  See what I'm saying?

Herman Cain says black voters don't vote 4 Repubs b/c they're "brainwashed." Maybe they don't vote 4 the party that works against them.

@RealRightRepub Denying them help and telling them to go screw themselves, which Repubs do, doesn't get them out of poverty.

@RealRightRepub Repubs continuously support tax cuts 4 the rich and cuts in social programs. Repubs R totally "support the little guy."

@VartanLA What about getting corporate money out of politics. Are you against that? It undermines our democracy.

@VartanLA Yes. U can't compare individuals 2 billion $ corporations. Politicians have less incentive to be representative of Americans.

@JavoBDC b/c obesity-related illnesses = 21% of health care costs in the US. It effects the cost of MY health care even though I'm healthy.

2012-06-01 22:34:16
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/208687938014425088
@JavoBDC And making birth control available to everyone is what Obama wants. That would lower the costs of unwanted pregnancies.

2012-06-01 22:34:47
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/208688068901879808
@JavoBDC So what do you propose for obesity? Just do nothing and allow the problem to get worse?

2012-06-01 22:35:47
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/208688318983045120
@TheManchild6789 @cenkuygur WTF, how does LGBT rights contribute to health care costs? Gays don't negatively effect society. Obesity does.

2012-06-01 23:30:22
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/208702055936827392
@JavoBDC I said same thing. But if AFTER that ppl R STILL obese we should tax unless person is diagnosed w/ a condition that leads 2 obesity

2012-06-01 23:34:57
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/208703208237965312
@JavoBDC BTW, pro-choice laws and BC lowers healthcare costs, which is consistent w/ my obesity argument.

2012-06-01 23:37:44
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/208703908959354880
@JavoBDC 1 more: unwanted pregnancies cost US $11 Bill a year. Obesity costs $190 Bill a year. Don't take my word for it. Look it up.

@dennypettway You have FIVE kids. You're going to pay private school tuition all by yourself? B/C that's what Republicans want. Good luck.

@AndrasTamas @GeoRalston Your tweets come from ignorance and the fact that you're deeply misinformed. I don't waste my time with that.

@AndrasTamas The discrimination is why they don't get promoted or get the higher paying position. I'm done arguing with a 12 year old.

@AndrasTamas You didn't own anything. You provide no evidence. You just speak out of your ass. I thought I knew it all at 18 too. It's ok.

@sammah101 Ok, I'll answer. I don't respect certain cultures, and that's my opinion. I don't care what you wear. None of my business.

2013-04-06 20:07:44
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/320628911367143424
@sammah101 But I'm not going to pretend that I like or respect Islam, or Christianity, or any other religion. I'm AGNOSTIC.

2013-04-06 20:08:11
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/320629024693039105
@sammah101 You should be secure with your religion and not care what my opinion is. I don't care what you think about agnostics...at all.

2013-04-06 20:09:15
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/320629295892557824
@sammah101 And again, I'm not telling you what you should or shouldn't wear. Your culture represses you. You happen to like it. That's fine.

2013-04-06 20:09:48
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/320629431150465025
@sammah101 And one last thing. My job revolves around criticism. I'm not afraid of it.

2013-04-06 20:58:27
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/320641677557633024
@sammah101 I guess you're afraid of criticism? Can u explain why women are forced to wear modest clothing in your culture, but men are not?

2013-04-06 21:02:12
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/320642619933868032
@sammah101 Are you honestly going to argue that some of the rules in Islam are not repressive for women?

2013-04-06 21:02:42
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/320642746111098880
@sammah101 And again, it's not just Islam. You see this in many religions. I'm not trying to offend or upset you. I'm sharing my opinion.

2013-04-06 21:03:33
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/320642960985309184
@sammah101 I would never try to pass a law to ban headdresses, or ban your religion. I don't agree with it, which is why I criticize it.

2013-04-06 21:03:50
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/320643031978106880
@sammah101 And what may be "moral" to you, is not necessarily moral to me.

https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/320644026061684736
@sammah101 For many women, the hijab is not a choice, it's a requirement. That's what I don't like about it.

2013-04-06 21:13:26
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/320645447150608384
@sammah101 Oh really? What about Saudi Arabia? Women are forced to wear it there. They don't have a choice.

2013-04-06 21:16:14
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/320646153437855744
@sammah101 Look, if you have the choice, and you choose to wear it, then that's your right and that's fine. I'm sorry to have offended you.

2013-04-06 21:16:42
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/320646270903517184
@sammah101 You should know that I'm not religious and I don't believe in organized religion at all. So my opinions will probably annoy you.

@waynespar I like the physical aspect of it. I'm not buying into the spirituality part of it. Yoga has a good overall message of being kind.

@thelyricalgod both made the stupid decision to wait until marriage. Do u expect her to do stay in a marriage w/ bad sexual chemistry?

2013-05-08 14:34:22
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/332141428803244033
@thelyricalgod Do you expect her to shut her mouth and have bad sex for the rest of her marriage? Do you think that would be fair to him?

@thelyricalgod U can't expect ppl to stay in an unhappy marriage. it wouldn't be fair to him. would feel the same way if roles reversed.

@Ifeedemlead @cenkuygur The issue of sexism is a really difficult to address, because it immediately turns into an us vs. them problem.

@Ifeedemlead @cenkuygur But I don't think that sexism is uniquely American. Many other countries have the same issue.

@TheGreatGooglie I know! All these women getting preggers by sleeping w/ themselves. Poor dudes screwed like that when they played no role.

2013-06-20 01:04:00
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/347520174137692160
@TheGreatGooglie It is a woman's choice. But it's also a guy's choice to have unprotected sex with her.

2013-06-20 01:04:31
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/347520304282759168
@TheGreatGooglie So you think guys can go around having unprotected sex and face no consequences if they produce offspring?

2013-06-20 01:19:02
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/347523956900765696
@TheGreatGooglie Because that happens every time! And I didn't say that, so don't put words in my mouth.

https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/347524063322845184

2013-06-20 01:20:43
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/347524377774018562
@TheGreatGooglie BTW, isn't taking care of your KIDS personal responsibility? Lol!

2013-06-20 01:25:04
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/347525476492918784
@TheGreatGooglie The woman has to face the consequences for the rest of her life. She accepts the responsibility.

2013-06-20 01:28:08
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/347526244809703424
@TheGreatGooglie I got it Dave. U think guys can get women pregnant and not pay a dime. You're the epitome of personal responsiblility.

2013-06-20 01:42:03
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/347529746445373441
@TheGreatGooglie I didn't say that.

2013-06-20 01:50:56
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/347531984983183361
@TheGreatGooglie No I didn't. Couples get pregnant w/ out the women lying about BC all the time!

https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/347532644038369280
@TheGreatGooglie Should the guy pay for the abortion, or is that on the women too?

2013-06-20 01:56:05
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/347533278686887937
@TheGreatGooglie So what exactly is the man's responsibility? I'm very curious.

2013-06-20 01:56:35
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/347533404440510467
@TheGreatGooglie Your thought process is: man has unprotected sex, faces no consequences under any circumstance.

2013-06-20 02:03:28
https://www.twitter.com/anakasparian/status/347535139330473984

#EricGarner literally begged and pleaded for cops to leave him alone. The COPS escalated the situation and it's on tape. No justice.
