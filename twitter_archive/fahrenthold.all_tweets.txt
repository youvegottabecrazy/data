@KennethBaer Thanks for your question! There was also $2M in stimulus checks in 2009, $100M detailed in SSA OIG testimony to Congress in May

https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/397441372732395520
@KennethBaer (1/3) Diff. reasons for mistake. June study was deaths included in one SSA file, but not on actual benefits list.

2013-11-04 19:14:34
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/397441759543713792
@KennethBaer (2/3) 2009 problem (described in letter to Coburn) was a problem with old SSA cases (those who turned 72 before '72).

2013-11-04 19:15:37
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/397442025961684992
@KennethBaer (3/3) $100M was people that SSA OIG identified as dead by comparing notes with Medicare. Deaths not in SSA files at all.

2013-11-04 19:19:29
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/397442997639315456

1.) At the govt's paperwork mine, not much changed. Workers still pass paper files hand to hand in underground caverns, just slightly faster

2014-12-29 16:21:50
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/549601192717058048
2.) Congress killed the Dog and Cat Fur report, and 47 others it didn't read. Progress! Then it ordered up 69 new reports. Problem worse.

2014-12-29 16:26:30
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/549602369093505025
3.) The VA (and Congress) battled tradition of fooling bosses with bad stats. But trust so short that VA Sec. gave out his personal cell #.

2014-12-29 16:30:08

2015-09-11 17:29:40
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/642389559419006976
1/21 There were 3 kinds of longshots. 1st, “why not” candidates: Gilmore (http://t.co/ih7Ril6JBM) and Pataki (http://t.co/ErHR9Spw3y)...

2015-09-11 17:31:07
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/642389923358752768
2/21 For Gilmore and Pataki there was never a rationale bigger than: the race was open. They had resumes. You never know.

2015-09-11 17:31:34
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/642390037808705540
3/21 2nd group was the 2012 alums: Santorum (http://t.co/wqbsDxQZRn) and Perry. At times both seem to be running—still—against Obama…

2015-09-11 17:32:46
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/642390338372567040
4/21 Santorum, in particular, wants to head off or undo Obama’s disasters. Not much of the future/optimism focus you see w/ an open race...

2015-09-11 17:33:54
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/642390625250377732
5/21 Santorum, in fact, often leaves out an optimistic, powerful part of his ’12 spiel, re his immigrant coal-miner grandfather…

2015-09-11 17:34:17
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/642390722155540480
6/21 Santo. '12: “I remember…not being able to take my eyes off his thick strong hands [that] gave his family a chance [at] American Dream.”

2015-09-11 17:35:18
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/642390975076282368
7/21 Now, Santorum calls for reducing legal AND illegal immigration. Hard to fit grandfather story in w/that. In 4 stops I saw, he didn't.

2015-09-11 17:35:54
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/642391128617185280
[Here's link to long-shot story on Santorum: http://t.co/wqbsDxQZRn]

2015-09-11 17:37:18
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/642391480305385472
8/21 For Perry: at start, he focused on un-doing regulations, Keystone pipeline, O’care &amp; Dodd-Frank.  Familiar GOP ground in '10, '12.

2015-09-11 17:39:13
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/642391961589182464
9/21 But in age of @realDonaldTrump , those ideas look almost wonky. Perry, so anti-Washington that he talked secesion, lumped w/insiders

2015-09-11 17:41:18
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/642392485126373377
10/21 3rd group is just.. Graham. He looks to the future, but darkly. What's in the future is sacrifice, compromise, war.

2015-09-11 17:42:43
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/642392843219152896
11/21 But Graham oddly  has energy others don’t, b/c this is all new. And, if he loses, he's still a senator. http://t.co/8ZYKCLfRzO

2015-09-11 17:44:37
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/642393322670133248
11a/21 Graham reminded me of a candidate from a dystopian novel, where something very bad has already happened, &amp; we've come to expect less.

2015-09-11 17:44:53
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/642393387052724224

https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/642394994532331520
16/21 All 5 attacked Trump as , in essence, a bad Republican. The Donald’s response always is: you’re way behind. He’s right. It hurts.

ATTENTION TWITTER: A reader--who says he is a retired circus clown--has written me a poem about tonight's undercard debate. Get ready...

2015-09-16 15:15:07
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/644167638667689984
1.) When I was a circus clown, with Ringling-Barnum-Bailey,

I had to warm the crowd up for the show by acting gaily...

2015-09-16 15:15:33
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/644167744875831296
2.) While the rubes were straggling in I capered like a monkey;
that is what you had to do if you were just a flunkey. ...

2015-09-16 15:15:55
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/644167839134425088
3. Now I read the same thing is about to start again

with an undercard debate on good ol' CNN....

2015-09-16 15:16:17
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/644167932394782720
4.) These candidates have neither luck nor any sane position

on which to base their presidential fairy tale ambition....

2015-09-16 15:16:33
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/644167998824124417
5.) It kinda makes me wonder who the real buffoons might be --

those at Ringling Brothers or the ones on my TV?

@sebastianjunger I'm a WaPo reporter, trying to find any vets' group that got a personal gift from @realdonaldtrump. He says he gave $1M.

2 questions: 1. How much, exactly, was raised? 
2. To which groups did you give the $1M donation of personal money?  https://t.co/v5CgOJJOQq

2016-05-24 02:49:06
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/734939249884188675
I'm still looking for this $1M that @realdonaldtrump says he gave vets out of his own pocket. If you got any, DM me. https://t.co/v5CgOJJOQq

2016-05-24 02:58:57
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/734941729862877184
1/ This is a good time for a recap of what we know about @realdonaldtrump's Jan. 28 fundraiser in Iowa... https://t.co/eL01y8zgYf

2016-05-24 03:00:19
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/734942071627390976
2/ First and foremost, it did raise at least $3.1M for veterans. We know there was $3.1M b/c vets groups got it https://t.co/eL01y8zgYf

2016-05-24 03:01:32
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/734942377639596033
3/ But there are still questions about the total $$  raised  -- and what @realdonaldtrump gave from his own pocket. https://t.co/eL01y8zgYf

2016-05-24 03:02:18
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/734942570615300096
4/ For instance, @realdonaldtrump said he'd raised $6M. Last week, his campaign mgr told me it was less --abt $4.5M https://t.co/eL01y8zgYf

2016-05-24 03:03:52
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/734942965915877376
5/ So how did $6M turn into $4.5M? @realdonaldtrump blamed unnamed donors who backed out.  https://t.co/QPDXNBenTO  https://t.co/eL01y8zgYf

2016-05-24 03:05:42
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/734943428971245569
6/ Since then,  campaign has said it's not $4.5M. @realdonaldtrump now says it's between $5M and $6M.  https://t.co/eL01y8zgYf

2016-05-24 03:06:40
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/734943670504427520
7/ @realdonaldtrump has not identified which donors backed out. He mentioned 9 donors onstage, including himself. https://t.co/eL01y8zgYf

2016-05-24 03:07:37
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/734943912020824065
8/ I've found evidence -- from vets groups, from donors, or from Trump staff--that at least 7 of the 9 paid up. https://t.co/eL01y8zgYf

2016-05-24 03:12:38
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/734945173487128577
11/ @realDonaldTrump says his $ has been given, but not to whom. I've been trying to find the vets groups who got it https://t.co/eL01y8zgYf

2016-05-24 03:13:14
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/734945321835474946
12/ Which, again -- if you received any of this $1M of Trump's personal money, DM me. https://t.co/eL01y8zgYf

2016-05-24 03:13:55
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/734945495341228032
13/ Bottom line: @realdonaldtrump fundraiser was a huge boost for the vets grps who got donations as a result. https://t.co/eL01y8zgYf

2016-05-24 03:15:30
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/734945894118887424
14/...But there are still questions about how much he raised, and how @realdonaldtrump met his personal $1M pledge https://t.co/eL01y8zgYf

3.) And, by IRS rules, nonprofits are "absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in...any political campaign."

2016-05-30 14:46:31
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/737294123049308160
4/ In Iowa, Trump seemed to flout those rules: he gave away checks w/ foundation's name on the top, campaign slogan on bottom...

2016-05-30 14:48:52
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/737294714664288256
5/ Then he stopped. How will Trump handle that issue 2morrow? He's giving away the foundation's $$, acting as head of a nonprofit...

2016-05-30 14:54:36
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/737296156582109184
7/ So how will @realdonaldtrump avoid appearance he's violating IRS rules, by using a charity to boost a political candidate (him)?

2016-05-30 15:08:07
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/737299555474100224

2016-05-30 22:22:17
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/737408819823775744

2016-05-30 22:23:31
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/737409128927272960
...they disagreed about what would be over the line. Would it be too much for @realdonaldtrump to use gifts as evidence he'd be good POTUS?

2016-05-30 22:24:24
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/737409353263796224

2016-05-30 22:28:15
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/737410321288069120

2016-05-30 22:29:23
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/737410605850595329

Tweetstorm about to commence, about @realdonaldtrump, charity, and another $1M-plus I can't seem to find...

2016-06-22 13:33:36
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/745610691462168577
1/Question: Before his $1M gift to vets in May, when was the last time @realdonaldtrump gave $1 of his own money to charity?

2016-06-22 13:36:12
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/745611347610722304
2/.@realdonaldtrump has said he gives "millions." But his foundation's tax records don't show that: Trump hasn't given it $1 since '08.

2016-06-22 13:37:57
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/745611785114390528
3/.@realdonaldtrump's explanation has been that he's giving privately, outside the Foundation, giving out millions without taking credit.

2016-06-22 13:40:15
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/745612367338344448
4/"There’s no way for you to know or understand what those gifts are or when they are made." Tump spox to @buzzfeed. https://t.co/TkhQT9MdRv

5/"Why should I tell you?...I've given millions of dollars away." That was @realdonaldtrump to WaPo this yr. https://t.co/3mo1MRrJ0d

2016-06-22 13:43:13
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/745613111835693056
6/And; in last yr @realdonaldtrump was supposed to give away at least $1.1M: combined royalties of 2 books, which he'd pledged to charity.

2016-06-22 13:45:10
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/745613605014474752
7/So: I set out to try and prove @realdonaldtrump right. Talked to 100+ grps, which seemed the most likely recipients of his private gifts.

14/Of the 102, just 10 had *any* record of a personal gift from @realdonaldtrump. But most of those were in 2008 or before.

2016-06-22 14:00:15
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/745617398716375041
15/So: before he gave $1M to vets, when did  @realdonaldtrump last give $1 of his own money? Last I've found was '09 https://t.co/gVK7Yi9pvP

2016-06-22 14:01:33

1/I've now spent a day trying to find the last time (before his $1m gift to vets) that @realdonaldtrump gave a personal donation to charity

2016-06-22 21:59:16
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/745737949124435968
2/I've now talked to 128 charities, all with some connection to Trump (they got gifts from his nonprofit, or he's written about them).

2016-06-22 22:00:20

2016-06-22 22:07:20
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/745739979150737408

1/@MichaelCohen212, atty for @realdonaldtrump, has called my story on Trump's charitable giving "patently false." Here's what I've found...

2016-07-01 00:52:11
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/748680564451008512
2/Since '01, @realdonaldtrump has promised to give $8.5M-plus of his own money to charity, incl. $ from Apprentice, a book, vodka, Trump U..

2016-07-01 00:55:22
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/748681367026798592
3/But he gave $2.8M -- 1/3 of that -- thru Donald J. Trump Fdn. [this is apart from the separate $1M pledge he made, and paid, to vets]

2016-07-01 00:56:14
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/748681584618901504
4/The explanation from @realdonaldtrump staff, is that he gave 'millions" privately, outside the Foundation. I'm trying to prove him right.

2016-07-01 00:59:05
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/748682304202141700
5/And so far, I can't. I asked 200 charities w/ ties to Trump, even enlisting a donor-search firm, if @realdonaldtrump gave them his own $.

2016-07-01 00:59:55
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/748682511966957568
6/In particular, I'm looking for gifts between '08 (when @realdonaldtrump made his last gift to his own Fdn) and $1M to vets in May.

2016-07-01 01:00:56
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/748682767756656641
7/And this is the result. So far. @MichaelCohen212 and @realDonaldTrump may about to tell me something I don't know https://t.co/G7xTn4F5ve

2016-07-01 01:17:24
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/748686911510896640

#210. In '13, @realdonaldtrump reportedly paid $100K for a 9-ft painting of his face. Proceeds supposedly went to @GuildHall, L.I. theater

4/@realdonaldtrump did not actually give his $1M donation until 4 mos. after he said he already had, only under intense media pressure.

2016-07-30 18:07:58
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/759450478300323840
5/@realdonaldtrump gave $1M in 1 check, days after @CLewandowski_ said it had already been given away...in secret. https://t.co/vcVIPu2YvZ

2016-07-30 18:08:44
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/759450670529478656
6/And @realdonaldtrump only gave away half of the *other* donors' $ after the media asked about it -- and did it in an apparent rush...

2016-07-30 18:10:32
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/759451122062991360
7/In fact, @realdonaldtrump's vetting was so poor, he gave $75K of other ppl's $ to a vets group with an "F" rating, and scam warnings.

2016-07-30 18:13:03
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/759451758523482113
8/In that case, @realdonaldtrump chose an F rated vets charity, tho literally the first 4 search results on Google are warnings or questions

2016-07-30 18:13:27
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/759451858792505344
9/Here's that story, on the F rated vets charity @realdonaldtrump gave other pp's $ to. https://t.co/VjLx2U2ifG

2016-07-30 18:13:59
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/759451991336714241
10/Beyond that, @realdonaldtrump has not been particularly generous -- at least for a billionaire -- to vets causes...

2016-07-30 18:14:31
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/759452124732358656
11/In the late 80s, for instance, @realdonaldtrump said he'd give royalties from The Art of the Deal to vets charities, among others...

2016-07-30 18:16:02
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/759452506988634114
12/But he actually gave more money to causes connected to Trump himself. Btw 87 - 91, Trump gave away $1.9M total, just $100K to vets.

2016-07-30 18:17:12
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/759452802032738305
13/In recent years, even when a vets charity -- the Wounded Warrior Project -- appeared on "The celebrity apprentice," Trump gave $0.

2016-07-30 18:20:21
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/759453595217649665
14/For instance, here's @realdonaldtrump praising the WWP on Twitter. He gave $0, from his Fdn or from his pocket. https://t.co/MYWHjJsYXj

2016-07-30 18:24:04
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/759454531080060928
15/So @realdonaldtrump did raise $ for vets, but the $4.5M other ppl gave on 1 night in IA is more than I can find Trump gave in a lifetime

2016-07-30 18:34:04
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/759457045091319808
16/Almost forgot: @realdonaldtrump has never given his own $ to  Veterans of Foreign Wars. 2 other men named Donald Trump have, in IN &amp; PA

5/I should say, money from a wealthy person's private or family fdn (like @realdonaldtrump's) is expected to come from person him/herself.

2016-10-13 20:17:19
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/786662118129078273
Remember that charity rules bar nonprofit leaders like @realDonaldTrump from using charity $ to buy things for themselves.

https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/786662512083234817
5/Later in the same yr, @realDonaldTrump Fdn gave a $15 "grant" to @NWF. That, also, was the price of an annual membership.

https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/786680751932710912
Mystery solved! I should have asked you all sooner. A loyal reader just provided the 1989 annual report of the Central Park Conservancy.

2016-10-13 21:31:33
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/786680799219310593
1/So here's the answer...

2016-10-13 21:33:04
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/786681183253962753
2/in 1989, remember, @realDonaldTrump's Foundation gave what is still the biggest gift in its history, $264K to the Central Park Conservancy

2016-10-13 21:34:42
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/786681593935036416
3/Back then, landowners near Grand Army Plaza, site of Trump-owned Plaza hotel,  were asked for a "window tax" to restore Pulitzer Fountain.

2016-10-13 21:38:27
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/786682537108238336
4/So, in 1989, did Central Park Conservancy say it had received $264K from Trump Foundation, a charity?

2016-10-13 21:39:32
https://www.twitter.com/fahrenthold/status/786682808571944960
