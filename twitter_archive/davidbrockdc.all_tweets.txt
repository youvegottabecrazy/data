The speed at which Ailes sidelined Kelly to make amends with Trump is revealing, shows that his ideological agenda outweighs everything else

2015-08-11 18:46:05
https://www.twitter.com/davidbrockdc/status/631174767693926400
Kelly is a pernicious purveyor of misinformation. Still, I can acknowledge Trump's attacks on her were sexist and inappropriate

2015-08-11 18:46:59
https://www.twitter.com/davidbrockdc/status/631174992575791104
This means that I, person who founded ​@mmfa​, have now said more to defend Kelly than Fox News' Roger Ailes has: https://t.co/IDePPQ1Abi

2015-08-11 18:49:50
https://www.twitter.com/davidbrockdc/status/631175708459573249
Ailes didn't come close to defending Kelly. Instead, it almost seems as though he issued a...stand down order...for Fox to back off Trump

Regarding @politico story: my point, somewhat buried, was that concerns about HRC emails are misplaced once you learn the facts.

2015-08-19 15:21:47
https://www.twitter.com/davidbrockdc/status/634022455678476288
Key point, which was not in the lede, is that when people express concern "the qualms go away once they know the facts and the evidence."

Focus on NYT faulty Clinton reporting isn't out of left field or off base. They have a history of enabling right-wing anti-Clinton attacks.

2015-09-10 14:11:50
https://www.twitter.com/davidbrockdc/status/641977382908350464
In this book, I analyze NYT record -- and make the case for concern of their Clinton reporting based on facts and my own personal experience

2015-09-10 14:14:15
https://www.twitter.com/davidbrockdc/status/641977993389297664
In book, I acknowledge that the Times is the paper of record. This is exactly why their faulty Clinton reporting really matters.

2015-09-10 14:16:58
https://www.twitter.com/davidbrockdc/status/641978674896609286
The NYT is the ideal host for right-wing misinformation. If NYT pushes, it automatically elevates and advances attack in news cycle.

2015-09-10 14:18:18
https://www.twitter.com/davidbrockdc/status/641979011007148032
Right-wing knows this. And they use it to their advantage. NYT shouldn't enable and record reveals case for concern. https://t.co/86u6gmlgTY

2015-09-10 16:13:46
https://www.twitter.com/davidbrockdc/status/642008068671303681
Given NYT status and role in the news media, it's important to challenge when they get something wrong. Especially when there's a pattern.
