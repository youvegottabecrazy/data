It’s annoying to go to the store in the middle of the night when you’re out of diapers, the baby’s crying, and you’re an exhausted parent.

2016-09-28 20:18:34
https://www.twitter.com/senfranken/status/781226618484383744
But that pales in comparison to the serious #DiaperNeed that families in Minnesota and across the country are facing right now.

Rep. Tom Price is @realDonaldTrump's nom for @HHSGov Secretary. His hearing is tomorrow in the Senate, but I want to see it delayed. Why?

2017-01-17 20:58:27

1) Bc reports revealed @RepTomPrice traded stock in companies while sponsoring legislation that could potentially affect those stock prices.

2017-01-17 20:58:53
https://www.twitter.com/senfranken/status/821461816580653056

#ForcedArbitration clauses are buried in contracts and they strip consumers and workers in MN and our nation of their right to go to court.

2017-03-06 22:33:21

Instead, consumers &amp; workers are forced into an arbitration system where corporations can write the rules. Everything can be done in secret.
