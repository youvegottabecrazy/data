Andrew Sullivan is the most dangerous man in America because he enables Obama's weakness and dresses it up as strategy. http://t.co/AbNmrFMk

Also, unsurprising that moderate Republican Sullivan loves moderate Republican Obama.He concedes throughout Obama took his ideas from right.

2012-01-22 03:42:26
https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/160930294470418432
Gingrich will say Obama more likable but too important time to elect someone who can't get the job done. Wrong, but might be effective.

https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/161647845026443264
Santorum said his grandpa left his dad behind for his first 5 yrs to come US. Maybe that's why Sant. keeps talking about the need for a dad.

Down side of watching this interesting Detroit-Houston Thanksgiving game is having to put up with Phil Simms.

2012-11-22 17:37:34
https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/271668760220430336
Simms just said the key for Detroit winning is to "Have a happier Thanksgiving" since they have lost 8 Thanksgivings in a row. Unbearable.

2012-11-22 17:38:41
https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/271669040848711680
Simms: Key to Houston winning is "stuffing" Calvin Johnson. Ha, ha, ha! Is there a less funny or interesting person in America?

2012-11-22 18:02:06
https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/271674936400150528
Simms on Stafford clearly overthrowing a wide open receiver: "A good throw, just misses him." You see, that would make it a bad throw.

2012-11-22 18:04:18
https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/271675487099682817
@LangeTheThird Except, I know they're corny. I mean them to be corny. You get the sense Simms thinks he was hilarious.

I like this competition we accidentally started - who is less interesting than Phil Simms? So far, best answers are Pawlenty and Brit Hume.

2012-11-22 18:09:46
https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/271676864546885633
I don't like Simms because he is epitome of sucking up to power for access. That's why he never says anything bad about players, refs, etc.

2012-11-22 18:10:58
https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/271677166167658496
My favorite Simms move is agreeing with the refs before they change the call AND after. Because refs and NFL have to be right 100% of time.

Iraq was madness because they had not attacked us and we had poor evidence of WMD (plus, no evidence on intent to use even if they had it).

Afghanistan war became useless and counterproductive after awhile. Stupid, military &amp; defense industry driven to stay for so long.

2013-08-30 19:03:21
https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/373521338570665984
In this case, evidence that regime used WMD is not solid, some of our top allies have pulled out, Cong. hasn't authorized &amp; UN hasn't voted.

https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/373522641832796160
If you pounded Syrian military, especially command &amp; control &amp; did it repeatedly, they would think twice about using WMD on civilians again.

I don't agree with Islam. I hate fundamentalism. But it's insane to think 1.6 billion Muslims are generally bad guys &amp; under suspicion.

What @BenAffleck was pointing out is that generalizations like ones @SamHarrisOrg and @billmaher are making is what leads to bigotry.

https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/518623366219960320
Interesting @SamHarrisOrg &amp; @billmaher justify Israel's overwhelming use of force, i.e. violence, but condemn Muslims for being too violent.

2014-10-05 04:52:00
https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/518624624163049472
When you drop bombs from planes and drones like America and Israel do, that's not violence. Only when Muslims do a bombing does it count.

Yes, there are some pernicious ideas in Islam that have taken root in the culture, like the idea of punishing apostates like me.

2014-10-05 14:03:07
https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/518763318018707456
But there are also dangerous ideas that have taken root in other religions, like Jesus is going to come back and kill almost everyone!

It looks like @SenSanders won Maine by about 30 points. Does it count? Press will probably dismiss as usual. #SuperSaturday

2016-03-07 01:27:49
https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/706652543254818816
Prediction: Since @SenSanders won Maine by so much establishment media will say it doesn't count because it's a pro-Bernie state.

2016-05-29 15:36:10
https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/736944226894675970
So @CNN does segment on whether they're biased against @BernieSanders and has three establishment pundits on who agree they're not! Comical!

https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/736945359268634624

https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/736946149626515457

https://www.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/736946722585206784

The president just said "radical Islamic terrorism." So, I guess it's solved. This is what idiot right-wingers have been saying for years.
