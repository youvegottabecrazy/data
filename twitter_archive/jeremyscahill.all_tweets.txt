@DanaHoule doesn't matter what i think. What matters is what actually happened... US demanded an occupation, Milosevic said no. US bombed

@DanaHoule are you serious? NATO forces did end up occupying parts of the country. I was there when they came in.

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/14800074626306050
@DanaHoule your Iraq WMD analogy is bankrupt. This was a case of the US threatening a country with a choice: be bombed or be occupied.

@DanaHoule "vehement opposition within the military?" Right. No "serious ground force?" Is that what you saw when you were there? I didn't

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/14801636950020096
@DanaHoule Have you actually read the agreement the US wanted Milosevic to sign? They knew he wouldn't sign. They wanted a pretext to bomb

Confirmed? RT @AinteJr: Ommar Hamammi, aka al-Amriki -America's Jihadist in Somalia is dead, said Foud Shangole, Shabaab's chief operation.

2013-05-07 20:21:43
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/331866456918728704

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/331867295217508353
@AinteJr interesting. Also, Fazul was killed by a militia and not the US.

2013-05-07 20:27:21
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/331867872131420161
If Hamammi is indeed dead, second major foreign fighter killed in Somalia in past few years by Somalis, not US (Fazul in June 2011).

2013-05-07 20:28:15

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/331870635666059265

@Ijok1998 I cover it extensively in my book. US intel reviewed emails and said there was no indication Awlaki was involved with plot

2013-06-15 22:10:46
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/346027027020795904
@Ijok1998 we explicitly mention Awlaki praising the killing of US soldiers. There is no evidence he was involved w that specific case.

2013-06-15 22:13:25
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/346027694082883584
@Ijok1998 why would that have been necessary if US intel determined he had nothing to do w the actual plot? It's not a tell all biopic.

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/346028185659531264
@Ijok1998 we aren't ignoring anything. It's a 90 minute film about multiple stories. We tried to summarize a lot in a little time

A few thoughts about al Shabaab and the US killing of its leader, Ahmed Godane, in #Somalia...

2014-09-05 18:29:55
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/507958822728916992
al Shabaab was fringe group in '06, embedded w/in the Islamic Courts Union, which took power in Mog., after expelling CIA-backed warlords.

2014-09-05 18:30:39
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/507959006598799360
The ICU was not al Shabaab and included many clan-based leaders and groups. It was not of one ideology at all, certainly not Shabaab's.

2014-09-05 18:31:08
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/507959128946647041
In 2006, 2007, the Bush administration covertly partnered with Ethiopia and invaded, shattering the ICU. It was a disastrous decision

2014-09-05 18:31:42
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/507959270496043008
US-backed Ethiopian forces engaged in a systematic, brutal occupation, while JSOC teams assassinated various ICU leaders

2014-09-05 18:31:57
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/507959336120111104
As a result, al Shabaab became a pseudo nationalistic Islamic vanguard, fighting the “crusaders.”

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/507959400515252224
The Bush admin’s policy in Somalia gave al Qaeda a major major gift—a stronghold in a country bin Laden always wanted to create as a base.

2014-09-05 18:32:44
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/507959532744900608
Prior to the US-backed invasion, al Qaeda had a minimal presence in Somalia, certainly when it came to foreign fighters

2014-09-05 18:33:10
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/507959641507393537
Ahmed Godane’s rise--and a spreading of Shabaab's brutality, was, in part, a direct result of US/Ethiopian policy.

2014-09-05 18:33:41
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/507959772935884802
That he is dead is indeed a major blow to Shabaab, but this is also a case of US helping create the threats it claims to be fighting against

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/507960133587337216

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/515657425593319424
@keithkloor @BenForer To ignore COMPLETELY context around what he was doing is total propaganda. There were ZERO references to Pal suffering

2015-01-10 20:38:59
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/554014564699107330

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/554014722228752385

Remember, after Christmas Day bomb plot in 2009, AQAP took credit soon after but waited 4 months to release a martyr video of Abdulmutallib.

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/555423260956180481
@AllThingsHLS @NoahShachtman That was in response to me asking what specific role Awlaki played.

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/555423509007335424
@AllThingsHLS @NoahShachtman My sense is Awlaki met with Kouachi(s?) in Yemen and facilitated intro to AQAP.

2015-01-14 17:59:06
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/555423876482891778
@AllThingsHLS @NoahShachtman Perhaps. They also could have just tipped off AQAP beforehand and had no recent comms or support.

2015-01-27 15:44:55
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/560101153820930048
It seems the point of this drone strike was to send a message that the US will keep up its drone strikes, so they kill a couple of nobodies.

2015-01-27 15:46:40
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/560101591261655040

Brennan's reorganizing of CIA seems eerily reminiscent of Rumsfeld's Office of Special Plans, which cherry-picked raw Intel to justify ops

2015-03-07 04:49:49
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/574069418826801152
Brennan is blurring line between ops and analysis. This will enable widening capacity for ops based on unverified Intel

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/575503065920446464
What the TS docs show is *systematic intent* to target security of *all* of our iPhones &amp; other devices. This is not about old hacks.

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/575504035190538240
The line that "oh, they will just target bad guys" is so naive. Once they hack Apple devices, the cat is out of the bag. It's game on.

2015-03-11 03:52:52
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/575504637710700544
If CIA /NSA find exploits to Apple's security &amp; don't tell Apple, they endanger all our security. You don't think China/Russia found it too?

2015-03-11 03:56:19
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/575505505910661121
Think about this: Say CIA used "whacked" Xcode to put malware on widely used iPhone apps, but claim only to target "bad guys." Trust em?

2015-03-11 03:58:11
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/575505975861469184
What CIA was doing at Jamboree was just *theoretical*. False. They claimed success in whacking Xcode, success in exploiting BitLocker.

@HafsaXMus @Rashid_Musa My point was Somalis in Yemen fled terrible violence in their homeland. Now they are being pulled out b/c of bombs

@HafsaXMus @Rashid_Musa I met many Somalis in Yemen. Their lives there are terribly difficult. They don't deserve this suffering.

@HafsaXMus @Rashid_Musa People who flee one country to find safety, then have to flee the other country b/c of mass violence is a crime

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/593591567316852736
The way "journalists" demand Black people condemn violent protests is how they should question US officials on their wars. But they won't.

Personal story: I lived in West Baltimore in the 1990s. We ran a free food pantry. One night, I got robbed at gun point by a guy we knew

2015-04-30 02:18:47
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/593600354304032768
A few weeks later, he came to our free food pantry and I was filling his bag. I said, "Dude, you robbed me a few weeks ago. What the fuck?"

2015-04-30 02:20:01
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/593600664523153408
I ended up talking to him for a few hours. His dad was killed by police over a minor shoplifting incident when he was 8 years old

2015-04-30 02:21:07
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/593600939082305537
His life was ruined. He told me the gun wasn't loaded, that he would never hurt me. He said he robbed me b/c he knew I wouldn't call cops

2015-04-30 02:22:24
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/593601262161141760
I have meditated about that often for the past 20 years. I was traumatized by the robbery, but that is not what I remember.

I include myself in that. The best white people can do is recognize we're recovering racists. We're born into a system that tells us we rule

@robcrilly No. I'm saying that unless you realize and understand how society grants you white privilege, you will become part of the problem

@robcrilly No. I think that is precisely what we should be doing. But not pretending those of us who are white are not operating w privilege

2015-04-30 03:08:19
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/593612817405718528
@robcrilly My point is that it is dangerous to confuse empathy with actual, real life understanding of literal circumstances.

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/593616474100600832
@robcrilly The solution is to embrace and recognize what we do not understand. Then we can be honest in how we report.

Fazul knew Mogadishu's streets well. My sources don't believe it was an accident at all. They believe he was set up by Shabaab.

2015-05-19 14:53:42
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/600675702376144896
Bin Laden had just died. Al Qaeda was not delivering $$ to Shabaab. And Shabaab was morphing into a criminal gang.

2015-05-19 14:54:15
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/600675843321507840
It now seems clear that Fazul's killing kicked off Shabaab's purge of its Western recruits who came there thinking they were fighting jihad

2015-05-19 14:54:38
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/600675939320758272
Shabaab was not about jihad. Shabaab is about Shabaab. And money.

2015-05-19 14:55:22
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/600676124092403712
When foreign fighters became inconvenient, Shabaab accused them of being spies and began assassinating them, torturing, imprisoning them

2015-05-19 14:56:07
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/600676311279996928

Last time I met w Tariq Aziz in Baghdad Feb. 2003, he said if the US overthrew Saddam, a Pandora's box would open that the US couldn't shut

2015-06-05 15:15:04
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/606841674577379328
Aziz's argument was that Arab nationalist movements were the only effective way to combat al Qaeda-style forces

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/724306672529903616
@chrislhayes He (rightly) blasts Clinton on her regime change love, but he backed regime change that resulted in lethal policy vs civilians.

@arendtiana @chrislhayes That 98 law made regime change in Iraq US policy and was used to justify invasion. It laid groundwork

2016-04-24 19:02:44
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/724312639011196928
@arendtiana @chrislhayes um, no. The US overthrew Qaddafi... that was regime change. Obama has also backed regime change in Syria.

2016-04-24 19:05:58
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/724313449434624000
@arendtiana @chrislhayes you can also make a very reasonable argument that Obama backed regime change in Egypt too. They supported Sisi coup

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/741308305432293376
@mikecherepko several significant problems w your comparison of these cases. Among them, Powell &amp; Rice didn't set up private servers

Omar Mateen worked for G4S, one of the largest mercenary firms. Their operatives are deployed in scores of countries, including war zones.

2016-06-12 19:49:21
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/742081374664921088

@tomas_engle @jpbng first off: after they acquired Armor Group, in midst of the PSC gold rush, G4S got into the merc game.

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/742104175929110528
@tomas_engle @jpbng G4S also has operated in Iraq, Afghanistan and South Sudan (where they worked alongside one faction in civil war).

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/742104331877515264

@tomas_engle @jpbng I appreciate your point that "mercenary" does not portray vast scope of G4S work. But "mall cop" is definitely not right

2016-06-12 21:23:45
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/742105130896592897
@tomas_engle @jpbng also, G4S has had sensitive DoD contracts for work *inside* the Pentagon. That's not "mall cops"

2016-06-12 21:28:34
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/742106342547181568
It will be important to understand full scope of what Mateen did for G4S, whether they knew of FBI looking into him, etc.

2016-06-12 21:29:38
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/742106613096587264

No doubt that the Bush admin was totally in bed w Saudi, but on a tactical level re Yemen, they were much smarter than Obama admin.

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/797160332036804608

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/797160983567417344
Trump will likely be much more malleable figure for the intel community, Special Ops and CIA to shape than Obama was.

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/797162754369056768

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/808344052110389248
@barkway @verny_thomas that is not really significant. Historically, that is how DNI functions--as the coordinator for these entities

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/808344873933897728

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/808345039269142528

@peterdaou If you bothered to watch any speech I gave during election before assuming, you'd know I never said any such thing. Opposite.

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/825909007726555137
@peterdaou In fact, I said repeatedly that on Supreme Court issue alone, it was necessary to defeat Trump. Over and over.

Obama killed a 16-year-old American in Yemen. Trump just killed his 8-year-old sister. https://t.co/bEm5R5XIoi by @ggreenwald

2017-01-30 13:38:19
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/826061984126869506
Remember: As so often is the case, the US claimed no civilians were killed &amp; all of the dead were terrorists.

2017-01-30 13:40:02
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/826062416169558016
Also, they always claim they got valuable intel, killed important people. My understanding is the men killed were low/midlevel functionaries

2017-01-30 13:41:05
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/826062680419082240
The family of the SEAL killed should demand to know why Trump sent him to die on this particular mission. Was it really for our security?

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/826063335493885952
For quite some time AQAP has been overwhelmingly focused on killing Houthis/Shiites in Yemen, not global jihad. They kill same people as US

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/826064374511050754
WH said they got valuable intel. If they took prisoners on the Yemen raid--which they may have--where will Trump put them? GTMO? Black site?

https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/826167574849273860
@yottapoint you are blatantly mischaracterizing my position. I said Trump will use this. They already are--see Sunday shows. Fact.

2017-01-30 20:39:55
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/826168083496697856
@yottapoint you are also wrong about this. CBP's methods used in watchlisting is precisely what Trump's ban/Order are relying on at airports

2017-01-30 20:40:50
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/826168315831783424
@yottapoint I never said that code was about Obama. I said Trump would cite that AND Obama's policies. What's wrong with you?

2017-01-30 22:01:28
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/826188607484370945
@yottapoint I said Trump would cite Obama policies and sections of US code in court/media in arguing his EO is legit. Which they already are

2017-01-30 22:02:44
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/826188926134034432
@yottapoint I did not say that I think that the argument has merit, nor am I drawing an equivalence between Trump and Obama.

2017-01-30 22:03:14
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/826189050537091076
@yottapoint There are aspects of Obama policies that are being used in his ban that stem from Obama watchlisting guidance.

2017-01-30 22:06:36
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/826189897492946944
@yottapoint I also didn't say I agreed. Of course it makes sense to assume I do and then tweet that false assumption. You're a real scholar!

2017-01-30 22:08:12
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/826190303233089537
@TomBetzNY yes, I am responsible for his reckless promotion of falsehoods because I didn't cater my tweets to five year olds. @yottapoint

2017-01-30 22:10:44
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/826190939492192256
@yottapoint both justified in the name of security/Exec auth. And this will definitely be part of Trump legal argument despite your tweets

2017-01-30 22:13:43
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/826191688766926848
@yottapoint you falsely implied that me stating a fact was endorsing those arguments.

2017-01-30 22:21:15
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/826193587180339201

So the vulnerability of Signal identified by the Vault 7 CIA docs is that intel agencies pwn individual phones rendering encryption moot?

2017-03-07 14:54:01
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/839127001113976832
Unless I am reading this wrong, that is true for almost any app/program run on any phone and not a "hack" of Signal, WhatsApp etc.

2017-03-07 14:55:40
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/839127414139682817
That has always been true of encryption. If your device gets keylogged or pwned, then encryption is compromised.

2017-03-07 14:58:37
https://www.twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/839128155772309504
