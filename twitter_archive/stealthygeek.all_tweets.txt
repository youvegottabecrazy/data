@pnh Because traffic observes the existing 25 mph limit? Pedestrians need to understand which side of the physics equasion they're on.

2014-03-30 20:35:06
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450370656686051328
@evilrooster Not stepping out into traffic without looking is. I've driven in NYC, peds there are uniquely blind to their surroundings.

2014-03-30 20:37:27
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450371248712056832
@evilrooster So the incompetence of NYC pedestrians is the fault of drivers? Just not following your logic here.

2014-03-30 20:39:03
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450371649565896705
@evilrooster And pedestrians shouldn't?

2014-03-30 20:46:17
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450373469788979200
@pnh No, I'm one of those people who understands that if I step in front of a 3,000 lb chunk of steel, the likely outcome is serious injury.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450374142148481025

@evilrooster @pnh No, I'm saying that you should look and that speed limits don't actually effect speed very much, only government revenue.

2014-03-30 21:00:10

@evilrooster @pnh Something else I didn't say. I look, because I understand what happens if I don't. Not sure why that's controversial.

2014-03-30 21:25:03
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450383227547815936
@fadeaccompli @evilrooster Also not what I said. There are two ways (at least) to accomplish the goal of fewer deaths.

2014-03-30 21:26:23
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450383560411996160
@evilrooster @pnh I certainly think I would share blame, yes. The automatic assumption that the driver is at fault is interesting.

2014-03-30 21:49:05
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450389272772628480
@evilrooster @neverjaunty @pnh So blame is determined by who is most harmed?

2014-03-30 21:50:49
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450389711261929472
@evilrooster @pnh As do I, because I am often one of them. But peds must also share the road with drivers, then. No?

2014-03-30 21:53:42
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450390437397012480
@pnh @evilrooster It truly is amazing all the things I said, without actually saying them. The iceberg theory of tweets.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450391160867934208
I made the critical mistake of saying Pedestrians should look before stepping into traffic. In NYC this is, apparently, SUPER CONTROVERCIAL!

2014-03-30 22:02:00
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450392526235521024
@evilrooster @pnh Yes, HORRIBLE THINGS, like the behavior of both pedestrians and drivers impact the safety of roads. Insanity!

2014-03-30 22:02:57
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450392765709295616
@evilrooster @pnh Funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you. What an odd coincidence.

2014-03-30 22:07:13
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450393839417565184
@evilrooster @pnh Absolutely. Both sides share responsibility. What I bristled against was the implication that drivers are always at fault.

2014-03-30 22:08:11

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450394665598996480
@evilrooster @pnh I never denied it, unlike some who seemed to assume that peds have no impact. I wonder what they could do to improve it?

2014-03-30 22:15:34
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450395939534934016
@evilrooster @pnh If by "based" you mean a complete distortion of my words, but for some reason, I don't feel that qualifies.

2014-03-30 22:22:01
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450397560876699648

@neverjaunty @evilrooster @pnh No, I did not. I objected to the assumption that drivers are always to blame.

2014-03-30 23:12:31
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450410271178100736
@neverjaunty @evilrooster @pnh Absolutely. So why not look at all of the causes when trying to decide on solutions?

2014-03-30 23:24:13
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450413217546633216
@pnh Missed this one. And no, I am arguing against your assumption that pedestrians are victims by default and never share responsibility.

2014-03-30 23:41:32
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/450417575432695808

2014-04-28 20:12:42
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/460874265143681024
@kellyswails It's reality. Folks talk about "wasteful spending" but when it comes time for specifics, cutting programs isn't popular.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/460874858524471296
@kellyswails For the government, a "better paying job" is revenue increase. Again, taxes.

@kellyswails Tax increases garner far more popular support than does spending cuts, even among self-described republicans.

2014-04-28 20:24:16
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/460877178952224768
@kellyswails But there's not enough fat to cut to make up the difference. Even ceasing all our discretionary spending wouldn't fill the gap.

I'm guilty too, but we all know #BoycottStarWarsVII is like, six racist cumfarts, right? That's not a movement, it's a sad basement party.

2015-10-20 23:50:25
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/656618505924669440
@erikscottdebie Yeah, kinda. Like, when the outrage over a thing becomes larger than the thing itself, maybe that's bad? Need a word for it.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/760156198918389762
@cakehler @Faria_Sheridan @thehill And since there have been zero, you can't increase nothing by 500%. Go on, try it on a calculator.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764110676302397441
@MerrellAmy Yes, lost the argument. "No. I meant he's the founder of ISIS." That's not sarcasm. That's not an opinion. It's the definition.

2016-08-12 14:48:41
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764111366923976704
@MerrellAmy Scotland, for one. Also anyone concerned with the viability of the European Union and the potential economic fallout to the U.S.

2016-08-12 14:49:05
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764111468371513344
@MerrellAmy But don't worry your empty little head about it.

2016-08-12 14:51:45
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764112139401457665
@MerrellAmy And no, the UK voted to leave by a very close margin. Scotland voted by more than 65% to remain. Keep up.

2016-08-12 15:07:07
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764116008122580992
@MerrellAmy Oh yes, we're on the precipice of another 70 straight months of private sector job creation. The horror.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764116321936302080
@MerrellAmy If we're not careful, we might get stuck with another two decades of lowering rates of violent crime. Jesus take the wheel!

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764116601570492418
@MerrellAmy Except I'm a conservative, but nice theory you had there.

2016-08-12 15:10:13
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764116786572910593
@MerrellAmy No, that was you being wrong and getting called out on it. Do you seriously not know what sarcasm actually means?

2016-08-12 15:13:59
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764117734137397249
@MerrellAmy I called him up and JC said he's got this. So you don't have to worry about voting. It's sorted out.

2016-08-12 15:16:19
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764118324959739904
Sarcasm: a walk-back used by assholes after they've said something offensive and have been publicly called out on it. #HowIronic

2016-08-12 15:18:51
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764118959448854528
@MerrellAmy No, I'm not, and no, it still isn't pertinent.

2016-08-12 15:20:19
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764119328778293248
@MerrellAmy Yes. Really. But we've already established that you don't understand what words mean.

2016-08-12 15:21:14
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764119561943875584

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764120084155621376
@MerrellAmy No dear, I'm not melting. Just peeling back the layers of your bullshit. There are so many.

2016-08-12 15:25:50
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764120717336150016
@MerrellAmy And you sound like my daughter. Well, when she was two. She's four now and already reading past your grade level.

2016-08-12 15:27:16
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764121077937307648
@MerrellAmy You have not shared any opinions. You have said things that are demonstrably untrue. Again, facts and opinions are different.

2016-08-12 15:29:38
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764121672827932672
@MerrellAmy No, I confirmed how old my daughter is. That doesn't tell you anything about how old I am. Are you new to Earth?

2016-08-12 15:31:41
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764122191764094977
@MerrellAmy Says the woman spending exactly as much time replying as I am. The difference is my jobs allow me to.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764122485751214080
@MerrellAmy I don't care how old you are.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764122904447647745
@MerrellAmy I work from everywhere. It's a nice perk of running your own business for a decade.

@bbeaulieu I remeber everyone saying he was going to move to the center for the general and I just laughed and laughed...

2016-08-12 15:59:44
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764129250735689728
@bbeaulieu It was ideal for floating to the top of a divide primary field among an extremist base, but complete suicide in the general.

2016-08-12 16:00:41
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764129488217247744
@bbeaulieu It's all he knows as a human being. He has only one gear.

2016-08-12 16:02:15
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764129882959974400
@bbeaulieu I'm not so sure. The bases are so far apart that I just don't see many pols actually moving back to the center anymore.

2016-08-12 16:02:46
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764130010840100864
@bbeaulieu But yes, Clinton has been very fortunate in her enemies this cycle.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764135248246497281
@bbeaulieu That's the Catch 22 that the GOP created for themselves when they decided to embrace and embolden the Tea Party. My heart bleeds.

2016-08-12 16:29:25
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764136719788761088
@bbeaulieu Can't. And with Trump, they'll fail to learn anything. They'll say he wasn't a "real conservative," and run further right. Again.

2016-08-12 16:33:47
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/764137816871825408
@bbeaulieu Not sure. But the GOP is one cycle away from becoming a regional party. If the Dems are in control for the 2020 census, done.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/766707950194786304
@rwgranny @thehill Your counting is fine? Is that why you can't differentiate numbers that are two orders of magnitude apart?

2016-08-19 19:00:42
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/766711504997486592
@rwgranny @thehill No, I am saying it isn't a valid comparison because the events are not at all proportional. Do you need me to slow down?

2016-08-19 19:05:33
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/766712726982799367
@rwgranny @thehill So the answer is yes, I need to make this even simpler before you're going to understand.

It's time the media stops covering @realDonaldTrump. Fact check the debates in detail, demand the release of his taxes, but no more. 1/1

2016-09-17 15:40:42
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/777170421305241600
The fact is, Trump has been plucking the violin strings of the press from Day One. He's embarrassed and exploited them with every cycle 2/2

2016-09-17 15:42:25
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/777170854778171392
But despite his abuse and disdain for the press, Trump cannot exist without them. His campaign is entirely reliant on them. 3/3

2016-09-17 15:44:21
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/777171342068178946
Trump lags in fundraising badly. He has no real ground game. Very little GOtV efforts. Short on field offices and volunteers. 4/4

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/777171701352243200
Without billions of dollars of free airtime gleefully handed to him by the press, Trump would have no campaign, and little visibility 5/5

2016-09-17 15:48:02
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/777172267293872128
Which is why the worst thing the press could do to him is to stop providing the platform and make him build his own, for once. 6/6

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/777173010142863360

@retrophoebia So you think it's ethical for him to pay $0 on $600m of income, while demanding everyone else pay to fix our infrastructure?

2016-09-29 14:02:24
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/781494338937294848
@retrophoebia And even to gloat about not contributing to his country? Because I don't. I think that makes him an asshole.

2016-09-29 14:04:12
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/781494790458318848
@retrophoebia And no, every citizen should NOT pay "as little as they can." Every citizen should pay their fair share. Or it doesn't work.

2016-09-29 14:06:28
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/781495360615251968

2016-09-29 14:06:54
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/781495472976490497
@retrophoebia Because you confuse "legal" with "ethical."

@retrophoebia And incidentally, we don't even know if what he's doing is legal. Because he won't release his taxe returns.

@dillinger_char @thehill Yes, biased towards reality. Unlike your easily manipulated internet surveys which can be flooded by anyone.

@dillinger_char @thehill It isn't the "American people." It's white supremacists on 4Chan manipulating surveys. Not hard to understand.

@RichKelsey We aren't all pulling down $600 m in a year, finding loopholes to pay 0, then bashing the poor for not paying taxes either.

2016-10-02 15:12:26

@RichKelsey Do you see the ethical difference now? Or are you actually that dense?

2016-10-02 15:15:23
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/782599867654889473
@RichKelsey You're right about that. I have never been so incompetent that I lost a billion dollars in an industry where folks hand me cash.

2016-10-02 15:16:59
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/782600273789419520
@RichKelsey But you missed the point. If you don't pay ANYTHING in taxes, you're not really in a position to attack the poor for the same.

2016-10-02 15:18:04

@StillNeverTrump "He never said..."
That's not directed to the specific video, that is a global statement and it is false.

2016-10-07 15:23:17
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784413795250757633
@StillNeverTrump That may be what you intended, but it's not what you wrote. Try harder. Also, stop pretending Cruz isn't supporting Trump.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784428932623896576
@StillNeverTrump Oh the hubris of those who think inexperience is superior to professional expertise. You made a global statement.

2016-10-07 16:26:16
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784429646322491392
@StillNeverTrump No sweetie, you did not. You made a global statement. "He never said vote for Trump."

Sorry, but he did. Deal with it.

2016-10-07 16:28:10
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784430123613319168
@StillNeverTrump And Cruz has your blinders tied on nice and tight. It does not matter that the news is "old." It remains true.

@StillNeverTrump No, dearie, it was not. That's what you're saying now that your claim has been disproven. Apologize and retract.

2016-10-07 16:31:45

@StillNeverTrump No dear. You are too prideful to admit your claim was false. You owe me the apology. And everyone else who read your tweet.

2016-10-07 16:34:02
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784431599735758848

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784432364189515780
@StillNeverTrump I don't need an "original" argument. I have the correct argument. Cruz is telling people to vote for Trump. That's reality.

2016-10-07 16:37:53
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784432568535953408
@StillNeverTrump A reality that, for whatever reason, you are unwilling or unable to accept. That's the real tragedy here.

2016-10-07 16:39:54
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784433077430910977
@StillNeverTrump Yeah, I'm not a Trump supporter, dear. We'll just add that to your growing list of false statements.

2016-10-07 16:41:35

2016-10-07 16:55:14
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784436938572902400
@StillNeverTrump Yes, I agree. Your disingenuous insistence that Cruz never told anyone to vote for Trump is incredibly lame. Apologize.

@StillNeverTrump Door's right over there whenever you want to leave.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784471604155875328
@StillNeverTrump About time you piped down.

2016-10-07 19:13:29
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784471730349891584
@StillNeverTrump Yeah. About what I expected.

2016-10-07 19:13:57
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784471846943064064
@StillNeverTrump I've already explained that's not going to happen, dear.

2016-10-07 19:18:15
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784472929866248193
@StillNeverTrump Well you, clearly. Otherwise, why are you still here? Looks like I'm, what was it, living in your head, rent free?

2016-10-07 19:29:26
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784475741899620352
@StillNeverTrump No, that's not it. You can't emotionally handle being called out, and you're not used to someone you can't bully away.

2016-10-07 19:31:25
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784476239658704896
@StillNeverTrump I think I'll put my flatscreen right over here, by the frontal lobes. Wait, there's not enough space. Hmm...

2016-10-07 19:34:53
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784477114154254336
@StillNeverTrump You poor delusional twit. You made a false claim. I corrected you. You are emotionally unable to deal with it, so you gif.

2016-10-07 19:35:54
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784477370547900420
@StillNeverTrump No one cares what impresses you, dear. No one is trying to.

2016-10-07 19:41:50
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784478861035790337
@StillNeverTrump Wouldn't know. Didn't lose this one. You're either not smart enough, or not honest enough, to admit you did.

Now, gif.

2016-10-07 19:42:22
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784478998655008768
@StillNeverTrump I'm not tweeting at you to impress you, silly twit.

2016-10-07 19:47:54
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784480390148947968
@StillNeverTrump Honey, you were wrong. Own it. Cruz has told people to vote for Trump. This is a thing adults call a "fact." Look it up.

2016-10-07 19:48:39
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784480576971608065
@StillNeverTrump Your approval or entertainment could not be of less importance to me.

2016-10-07 19:49:42
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784480842559160320
@StillNeverTrump You do know what facts are, yes? They're things that remain true even when you don't want to believe them.

2016-10-07 19:54:57
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784482162632450048
@StillNeverTrump No dear. I am pointing out your failure. The one your pride prevents you from admitting.

2016-10-07 19:56:12
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784482478476054528
@StillNeverTrump Good for you. My dog's squeaky toys always sounded like they were having fun being chewed on, too.

2016-10-07 19:57:07
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784482710311936000
@StillNeverTrump No I will never get whatever twisted nonsense is rattling around in your head. Then again, why would anyone want to?

2016-10-07 20:06:59
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784485192950046721
@StillNeverTrump You've made enough noise for one day, kiddo. It's time for your milk box and your nap now.

2016-10-07 20:08:24
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784485549063204864
@StillNeverTrump Stop making false claims and people will stop pointing them out to you, dear. And if you can't, don't complain. Simple.

2016-10-07 20:14:38
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784487116579504128
@StillNeverTrump You keep avoiding accountability. Must hurt to be an infant trapped in an adult body.

2016-10-07 20:16:52
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784487679060738048
@StillNeverTrump Go lay down with the other kids and let teacher have a little quiet time, sweetie. You're why everyone around you drinks.

2016-10-07 20:21:05
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784488740521738241
@StillNeverTrump Honey, there was nothing to misunderstand. I understood what you wrote perfectly. You failed to convey what you meant.

2016-10-07 20:22:26
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784489079043915776
@StillNeverTrump Yes, you have to learn what facts are. Facts like Cruz endorsed Trump weeks ago. Learn. Then speak. Until then, hush.

2016-10-07 20:30:58
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784491228964462592
@StillNeverTrump Bzzzz. Wrong. Thanks for playing, but you've lost the round. Pick up your consolation prize at the sign-in desk.

2016-10-07 20:32:32
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784491622004318209
@StillNeverTrump No dear. It was you who refused to recognize the context. And contunue to refuse to accept your error. It's pathetic.

2016-10-07 20:35:31
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784492372826681344
@StillNeverTrump Besides, what you meant was stupid as shit. Unless you believe a guy sitting under TRUMP/PENCE sig… https://t.co/7QBQ4VesX6

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784492736313495552
@StillNeverTrump Honey, you aren't "allowing" anything. Meanwhile, you continue flopping around on the sand like a freshly landed fish.

2016-10-07 20:38:01
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784493002756657153
@StillNeverTrump Go take your nap already. You're obviously tired and out of steam. Your parents will be here to get you when you wake up.

2016-10-07 20:44:12
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784494559837519873
@StillNeverTrump I'm not the one who needs help, dear.

2016-10-07 20:46:03
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784495021894541312
@StillNeverTrump What you are getting out of this is of no consequence, dear. Flop, fish.

2016-10-07 20:48:02
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784495524279881728
@StillNeverTrump Sweetie, you wouldn't recognize logic if it had to run out and buy you a morning-after pill.

2016-10-07 20:49:34
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784495910533394432
@StillNeverTrump Only a colossal moron would argue a man making calls for a candidate they endorsed isn't asking people to vote for them.

2016-10-07 20:50:05
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784496037562122240
@StillNeverTrump Go play in traffic, dear.

2016-10-07 20:53:00
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784496770881613825
@StillNeverTrump Sweetie, I watched the video yesterday. You were wrong, in any sense. He is phonebanking for Trump. He has endorsed Trump.

2016-10-07 20:54:04
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784497041632354304
@StillNeverTrump I'm three 12 year olds. And they're all more informed than you.

2016-10-07 20:57:02
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784497785651494912
@StillNeverTrump As he sits in a Trump campaign phone center. Being video recorded under a Trump sign. You really are an idiot.

2016-10-07 20:58:46
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784498225738833921
@StillNeverTrump It's amusing to watch you pretend to be anything but a hamper full of dirty diapers masquerading as an actual person.

2016-10-07 20:59:40
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784498450427699200
@StillNeverTrump Then you are free to go. Far away from other people.

2016-10-07 21:02:29
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784499160833753088
@StillNeverTrump Wow, you're so clever and original. Tell you what, we're going to put this gif right on the fridge, would you like that?

2016-10-07 21:02:59
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784499285115170816
@StillNeverTrump Ladies first. I insist.

2016-10-07 21:08:44
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784500731600592896
@StillNeverTrump Cool. We'll put it right up here next to your finger-painting of a "dog," or whatever that's supposed to be.

2016-10-07 21:09:57
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784501038976004097
@StillNeverTrump That's you, dear. You're the lady. I'm a gentleman holding the door for you.

2016-10-07 21:11:28
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784501419973967872
@StillNeverTrump All the servers at Chili's hate you. You know that, right? They have to smile because it's their job.

2016-10-07 21:12:32
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784501686517764098
@StillNeverTrump And you are no lady. Or you would accept your mistakes and apologize. Now, it's long past time for your nap.

2016-10-07 21:14:16
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784502124474404864
@StillNeverTrump No, dear. But I do like to write at the bar sometimes, and they all talk about you as soon as you leave.

2016-10-07 21:16:45
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784502750965067776
@StillNeverTrump Another yawn, kiddo? Take your nap. You're going to get cranky and make an even bigger fool of yourself.

2016-10-07 21:18:12
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784503113944338432
@StillNeverTrump Honey, you've never had a creative thought in your life. It's one reason everyone around you needs alcohol.

2016-10-07 21:29:41
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784506004419534848
@StillNeverTrump You don't get things, dear. You watch them fly high over your pointy head and wave.

2016-10-07 21:32:12
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784506636627050497
@StillNeverTrump You don't know what success look like, dear, having never experienced it yourself.

2016-10-07 21:33:30
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784506964034351104
@StillNeverTrump You have not shared a single atom of substance. Just insults, gifs, and denials. Pathetic.

2016-10-07 21:37:14
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784507906020564992
@StillNeverTrump That's all you got? Another transparently false claim for the list?

2016-10-07 21:39:11
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784508395856560128
@StillNeverTrump You have offered nothing to build from. Becauae you're simply a parrot, mindlessly repeating yourself. Want a cracker?

2016-10-07 21:40:37
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784508756323397632
@StillNeverTrump Yep, that's all you've got. Do your parents know you're using their computer?

@StillNeverTrump Squak! Good bird. Here's a grape. Now, squak another gif for your daddy.

2016-10-07 21:45:59
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784510107048636416
@StillNeverTrump I'm not a woman, dear. You are avery confused little troll.

2016-10-07 21:49:21
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784510954943942661
@StillNeverTrump Oh look, you're being derivative of yourself. That takes a special kind of talentless hack. Congrats. Now, where's my gif?

2016-10-07 21:51:54
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784511593287716865
@StillNeverTrump I don't have writer's block. I'm writing a book while I toy with you. Now where's my gif? Do you want another grape or not?

2016-10-07 22:16:19
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784517739327131650
@StillNeverTrump Aww. You caved. First smart thing you've done. Probably ever. This was great, but you're done here. Permanently.

2016-10-07 22:29:16
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784521000482377729

Trump is not only losing this election, but he's losing Mike Pence's election in 2020. The party itself may never win another Presidency.

2016-10-07 23:22:30
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784534396657360897
@PrinceJvstin Very little chance of that. The heart of the GOP is dying off, and they've burned bridges with every growing demographic.

2016-10-07 23:23:32
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/784534653625626624
@PrinceJvstin Latinos, blacks, lgbt, college educated, and now probably women are lost to them for a generation. Maybe longer.

@lear_shane @popspeters1 @thehill No, PP is reimbursed for the shipping costs of donating fetal tissues which save lives of actual humans.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/791021593564745728
@lear_shane It is legal because it is sometimes medically necessary to save the the mother. It's also incredibly rare after 22 weeks.

2016-10-25 21:01:39
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/791021930631589888
@lear_shane Less than 2% of abortions take place after 22 weeks, and nearly all are due to complications with the pregnancy, not by choice.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/797681224785469440
@RyanHowse Again, no. Luke fulfilled Obi Wan and Yoda's goal of killing Palpatine, although ultimately it was Vader who finished the job.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/806530688589660160
@Lite_Right @ticki_ And using that methodology, unemployment has gone from a peak of 10% to less than 5% under Obama. Facts, son. Get some.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/806530983642230784

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/806532799146692608

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/806533017846054912

Only two ways I see to neutralize this threat. 1) The media digs up this material on its own and reports it, no matter how damaging.

2017-01-10 23:17:00
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/818959860696051712
And 2) Congress either begins an impeachment immediately upon him taking office, or invokes the 25th Ammendment to remove him as unfit.

2017-01-10 23:18:16
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/818960176619384834
That's it. Trump isn't going to disclose the info himself. And he'll never admit that he's been blackmailed. We have to remove him. Now.

What will never make sense to me is why Trump, knowing all of this was waiting to be dug up, ran in the first place. How fucking arrogant.

@maxine_bowden They even hate gays just as much as you do. You'll love it there.

America just isn't for you.

@maxine_bowden Allowing trans students to use public restrooms does not trample the rights of cis-gendered. It would only be fascist not to.

2017-01-14 18:14:09
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820333197275832320
@maxine_bowden Allowing trans students to pee safely is not discrimination against cis-gendered students. You are terribly confused.

2017-01-14 18:16:15
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820333721882685441
@maxine_bowden That's like arguing black people using public water fountains discriminated against whites. It's ignorant and insane.

2017-01-14 18:18:02
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820334171558203392
@maxine_bowden Wrong again. You have religious liberty in your private life. If you open a business to the public, you can't discriminate.

2017-01-14 18:19:25
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820334518913658881
@maxine_bowden This is to protect their religious liberty just as much as yours. If you run a business, you agree to a new set of rules.

2017-01-14 18:20:22
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820334759972835328
@maxine_bowden I just looked at my copy of the Constitution and didn't see that line. Which Article is it in?

2017-01-14 18:21:42
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820335096670601218
@maxine_bowden No one is imposing beliefs on you. You can be a hateful idiot all you like. But you don't get to impose your hate on the law.

2017-01-14 18:22:08
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820335203264724992
@maxine_bowden THAT would be fascism.

2017-01-14 18:24:00
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820335673802653697
@maxine_bowden Wrong again. Biblical arguments were used to justify everything from slavery, to segrigation, and yes, IR marriage bans.

2017-01-14 18:24:38
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820335833823723520
@maxine_bowden Yeah, looked there, too. Doesn't say anything about hating gays.

2017-01-14 18:26:38
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820336337429655553
@maxine_bowden The transgendered have religion too, dear. Maybe if you actually talked to one instead of reflexively hating them, you'd know

2017-01-14 18:27:33
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820336567218798593
@maxine_bowden Goes for gays, too. Why do you think they want to get married in the first place? Many are very religious.

2017-01-14 18:28:23
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820336775864483845
@maxine_bowden Wrong again. No one is trying to stop you from expressing your ignorant hate in public. Go ahead.

2017-01-14 18:29:21
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820337018827841538
@maxine_bowden But if you choose to serve the public with a business, that means you choose to serve all of it. Don't like it? Don't open.

2017-01-14 18:35:14
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820338500637720576
@maxine_bowden That's your interpretation. Other Churches believe differently. Their religious liberty deserves protection as much as yours.

2017-01-14 18:37:02
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820338952490061825
@maxine_bowden Wrong again. The rights of all are honored equally. And I know God has set many gays free. I've married a gay couple. Freedom

2017-01-14 18:39:07
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820339480242569216
@maxine_bowden How much should I charge to sell my daughter into slavery? God was big on that, too.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820342368402624512
@maxine_bowden Exactly. Jesus doesn't care which sin you commit. So why do you act like homosexuality is the only exception?

Hate is why.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820343097481658368
@maxine_bowden Christ didn't write Leviticus, dear. He did wash away all of the old rules found therein, however.

Didn't you know that?

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820343663289135104
@maxine_bowden Being LGTBQ is not a "symbol of unresolved issues from childhood." Your ignorance is very telling.

2017-01-14 18:56:47
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820343923709243392
@maxine_bowden You have never understood love. And you are running out of time to learn.

2017-01-14 19:00:17
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820344805909790722
@maxine_bowden And He still didn't say anything about gays being a special kind of unforgivable sinner, dear.

That's your hangup.

2017-01-14 19:04:42
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820345918092443648
@maxine_bowden I'm quite confident that I am better prepared for that conversation than you are.

2017-01-14 19:05:42

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820347114471489539
@maxine_bowden That's your belief. Other Christians, millions of them, disagree.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820732880632631298
@DebatesJ I guarantee you there is an end to it. Either in an annual deductible, or a max out of pocket cap.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820733808228110336
@DebatesJ A 50% coinsurance plan with no MOOP or deductible would be illegal under the ACA. They were the sorts of plans that didn't qual.

2017-01-15 21:08:21
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/820739424208257024
@DebatesJ You have coinsurance through the deductible period until you hit $13k. That's what it's telling you.

When you have to use fake massacres to justify your muslim ban, while burying real ones so you can ignore white terrorism, that's racism.

So I read through @SpeakerRyan's ACA replacement plan in brief. It's a glorification of HSAs that don't work for the majority of households.

2017-02-17 00:55:36
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/832393022474170368
Getting a tax break for money you put in a medical savongs account sounds great, but most people simply don't have the cash to set asside.

How many people have to dip into their IRA when a big bill hits? Most folks somply don't have a few extra thousand bucks a year to spare.

2017-02-17 00:57:59
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/832393621848649730
@SpeakerRyan's plan pretty much guarantees a return to the sky-high rates of medical bankruptcies we saw prior to the ACA.

2017-02-17 00:58:43
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/832393807677251584
Which just means those costs are written off by providers and passed along to the rest of us anyway as higher premiums. It's the old system.

2017-02-17 01:06:30
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/832395767503585280
HSAs disguise their true costs by shifting risk from the insurer back to the policy holder, which reduces premiums by covering less.

2017-02-17 01:07:35
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/832396040905056256
They aren't inherently bad. I've sold a few. But to be appropriate and viable, the buyer needs a fairly significant income and good health.

2017-02-17 01:09:07
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/832396425988280320
Without both, they don't make financial sense long term in my opinion. Most people lack either the income, or have health conditions.

As @robertjbennett noted, Milo is the right's favorite gay because he reinforces all the negative stereotypes they hold about lgtbq people.

2017-02-20 16:54:41
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/833721546535555072
Milo is:
-flamboyant
-loud
-amoral
-hypersexual
-and now a pedophile 
He's the perfect image of the "other" conservatives want gays to be.

2017-02-20 16:56:58
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/833722121536860161
The gays that terrify the GOP aren't Milo. He's useful to them. It's the normal, married, hard-working family lgtbq people they can't abide.

2017-02-20 17:01:03
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/833723149690748932
Because a married, monogamous, gay couple going to work, paying taxes, and raising kids destroys their narrative of lgtbq being "broken."

2017-02-20 17:02:56
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/833723625752649728
So they put Milo the sideshow act on stage where he can represent the worst face of his own people. Of course they cheer him on.

1/ The FISA warrant of Trump isn't new. We've known about it for two months. So why is he bringing it up now? https://t.co/adf9XLRBoY

2017-03-04 17:02:18
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/838072120798142465
2/ My guess? This whole thing is building to a crescendo. Sen Coons said yesterday the FBI has transcripts that prove collusion w/ Russia.

2017-03-04 17:04:05
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/838072568745598978
3/ The game is almost up. Trump knows what he did, so he's taking a desperate shot to once more try to delegitimize the process.

2017-03-04 17:05:15
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/838072863051542528
4/ It's not the FBI doing this, under the same director that handed him the White House. It's Obama! It's all a conspiracy against him!

2017-03-04 17:06:59
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/838073295735922688

1/ The GOP #ACA replacement not only strips the Medicaid expansion and penalizes low incomes, but changes age premium ratio from 3:1 to 5:1.

2017-03-07 01:07:27
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/838918986255511559
2/ Which means that Trump's voters, white working class who trend older, will be hardest hit by ACA repeal. They lose the most coverage.

2017-03-07 01:12:24
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/838920233519820800
3/ Their communities will feel the impact disproportionately. They voted themselves even deeper into poverty, and earlier to the grave.

2017-03-07 01:14:34

2017-03-07 01:22:51
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/838922860961886208

2017-03-07 01:24:00
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/838923153288081408

@atn1972 Because the 24 million comes from not only the exchanges and Mediciad, but losses from employer groups plans, too. That's how.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841662120408281090
@atn1972 Everyone, everywhere is "covered" under the ACA. Because it's not an insurance plan. It's a set of reforms of the healthcare system

2017-03-14 14:49:21
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841662540912439297
@atn1972 The #AHCA disrupts that system fundamentally, and has cascading effects across the entire field, not just the &gt;20m. It's that bad.

2017-03-14 14:50:13
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841662757288194048

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841663748687429633
@atn1972 This isn't about media spin. Yes, there are around 20 million people directly enrolled in exchange plans and Medicaid expansion.

2017-03-14 14:55:46
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841664152896708610
@atn1972 But they are not the only ones effected. For example, I have a non-exchange individual plan. The entire individual market is at...

2017-03-14 14:57:09
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841664503930535937
@atn1972 ...risk if the #AHCA is passed. My premiums are set to skyrocket right along with plans on the exchanges with no mandate.

2017-03-14 14:58:16
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841664784437264385
@atn1972 Sans individual mandate, all the risk pools will go back to tilting older and sicker, ie more expensive to insure.

2017-03-14 14:59:38
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841665128504414210
@atn1972 Driving out the young and healthy, triggering a premium death spiral if not properly managed. That's how you get to 24 million.

2017-03-14 15:00:56
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841665456788365312
@atn1972 Not to mention the effects it'll have on the group market. Hell, the White House's own internal projections were worse at 26m.

2017-03-14 15:03:11
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841666019668217856
@atn1972 Bzzzz. Wrong. Without the individual mandate in place to keep the young and healthy on policy, risk pools sour. Premiums jump.

2017-03-14 15:04:25
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841666329916633088
@atn1972 You really don't have the first clue what you're talking about. Do you?

2017-03-14 15:05:37
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841666632611201024
@atn1972 Who has the luxury of choosing not to buy insurance if they "don't have to?" The young and healthy. The old and sick can't choose.

2017-03-14 15:06:31
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841666861032996867
@atn1972 So when your risk pool is swimming with old age and conplex medical issues, what do you think that does to your claims rate?

2017-03-14 15:07:04
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841666997914066945
@atn1972 When your claims rate skyrockets, what do you think happens to your premiums?

2017-03-14 15:08:02
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841667242450378753
@atn1972 This is super basic stuff, son. Understanding the mechanisms of insurance literally does not get any more fundamental than this.

2017-03-14 15:09:45
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841667673482223617
@atn1972 Again, no. The mandate drives down costs, or at least bends down the cost curve, by expanding the risk pool. That really happened.

2017-03-14 15:11:51
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841668200135839744
@atn1972 That's wonderful. It's also requires far more government regulation and intrusion into the private market than the ACA.

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/841668492243918854

The tax story proves two things: 1) Americans really want to see Trump's taxes. 2) Trump lied when he said he couldn't release them.

2017-03-15 13:56:05
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/842011524470317061
If they were leaked by the WH, that means the 2005 returns were the least scandalous of any year. Find the others.

2017-03-15 13:57:56
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/842011988800749568
It also means they WH really doesn't want us to be talking about something else. Probably coming confirmation of FBI Russia investigation.

2017-03-15 14:00:25
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/842012612971880448
Remember, between the two years of Trump's income we've seen, he's still more than $800 million in the hole.

2017-03-15 14:09:59
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/842015022456926208
Seeing there has been basically no response from the WH, no early morning Twitter meltdown, I think it likely Trump leaked his own taxes.

2017-03-15 14:13:38
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/842015938249666560

https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/842016195473739777
But they should also demand the rest of Trump's taxes, right through to 2016. 2005 was before he became heavily leveraged in Russia.

2017-03-15 14:15:43
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/842016462671876098
2005 was before US banks realized he was a shit investment and stopped lending money to him. Which is why it was safe to leak that year.

2017-03-15 14:34:53
https://www.twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/842021287228764160
The Steele dossier said Russian Intel had been grooming Trump as an asset since 2011. That and subsequent years are where the story lays.
