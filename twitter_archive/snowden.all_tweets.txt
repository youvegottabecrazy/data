#SafeHarbor was abused under US law due to #FAA702, which allowed a US official to authorize spies to monitor people without court orders.

2015-10-06 13:22:43
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/651387108486213632
#FAA702 allows NSA to intercept communications on the basis of class-based certifications signed by the AG instead of court orders.

2015-10-06 13:25:02
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/651387691670597632
#FAA702 surveillance of an ordinary German citizen does not involve demonstrating probable cause to a court or even judge.

2015-10-06 13:27:37
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/651388339782819840
Instead, NSA analysts can arbitrarily effect a search that meets the AG's certification on simple grounds of "suspicion."

This can be done without the involvement of any company via #UPSTREAM surveillance, or with the company's knowledge via #PRISM.

2015-10-06 13:30:21
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/651389031071252480
The #CJEU decision on #SafeHarbor can't strike #FAA702 off the books in the US, but it shows it does not comport with international law.

2015-10-06 13:34:07
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/651389978786836480
Bottom line: the #SafeHarbor ruling indicates the indiscriminate interception of communications is a violation of rights. Search OR seizure.

The problem with the new #SnoopersCharter is trying to fit the law around the spying, rather than making spying fit the law. It's backwards.

@tqbf Many *are* talking about all exploits without any nuance. Juniper's Dual EC point change unlikely to be NSA -- USG notified them!

2015-12-24 15:57:01
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/680054580328185856
@tqbf It works like this: 1) NSA encourages credulous partners to adopt Dual-EC via NCSC (https://t.co/G4QTDRTPm0). Some do. Some weak.

2015-12-24 15:59:58
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/680055321243578368
@tqbf Vendors aren't explicitly asked to "backdoor" products. Too risky. Even NCSC unlikely to know when NSA recs poisoned. No need to know.

2015-12-24 16:01:22
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/680055677461622784
@tqbf 2) When unwitting backdoor efforts fail (example, nonstandard point adoption), NSA simply moves on. Likely what happened with Juniper.

2015-12-24 16:05:03
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/680056603987558401
@tqbf 3) No way to know if Juniper voluntarily shared their non-standard points with NSA (many do), but time-til- detection implies did not.

2015-12-24 16:07:34
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/680057235825901572
@tqbf 4) Top-tier adversary subverts the backdoored standard (then-unusable) in ScreenOS codebase. NSA doesn't notice, bc not using.

2015-12-24 16:11:36
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/680058252508442624
@tqbf 5) CI effort or NTOC catches adversary in act of Juniper exploitation or using Dual-EC for exfil. Investigate. Discovery.

2015-12-24 16:13:51
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/680058815014932480
@tqbf 6) NSA, realizing their bad standard has been subverted by the adversary, takes action to close. Notifies Juniper (likely via cutout).

https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/680063012615655425

2015-12-24 16:36:47
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/680064588130443264

@AoDespair Mass surveillance isn't without *any* value, it's just without value in thwarting attacks -- which was the public justification.

https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/711575518974496769

Evidence that could publicly attribute responsibility for the DNC hack certainly exists at #NSA, but DNI traditionally objects to sharing.

2016-07-25 14:05:53
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/757577614873755648
The aversion to sharing #NSA evidence is fear of revealing "sources and methods" of intel collection, but #XKEYSCORE is now publicly known.

https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/757578400915660802

The hack of an NSA malware staging server is not unprecedented, but the publication of the take is. Here's what you need to know: (1/x)

2016-08-16 11:41:21
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/765513776372342784
1) NSA traces and targets malware C2 servers in a practice called Counter Computer Network Exploitation, or CCNE. So do our rivals.

2016-08-16 11:41:54
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/765513915094667265
2) NSA is often lurking undetected for years on the C2 and ORBs (proxy hops) of state hackers. This is how we follow their operations.

2016-08-16 11:42:35
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/765514087044374529
3) This is how we steal their rivals' hacking tools and reverse-engineer them to create "fingerprints" to help us detect them in the future.

2016-08-16 11:43:06
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/765514215562043392
4) Here's where it gets interesting: the NSA is not made of magic. Our rivals do the same thing to us -- and occasionally succeed.

2016-08-16 11:43:37
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/765514347196084224
5) Knowing this, NSA's hackers (TAO) are told not to leave their hack tools ("binaries") on the server after an op. But people get lazy.

2016-08-16 11:44:08
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/765514477341143040
6) What's new? NSA malware staging servers getting hacked by a rival is not new. A rival publicly demonstrating they have done so is.

2016-08-16 11:45:11
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/765514740747669505
7) Why did they do it? No one knows, but I suspect this is more diplomacy than intelligence, related to the escalation around the DNC hack.

2016-08-16 11:45:47
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/765514891813945344
8) Circumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom indicates Russian responsibility. Here's why that is significant:

2016-08-16 11:46:33
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/765515087062982656
9) This leak is likely a warning that someone can prove US responsibility for any attacks that originated from this malware server.

2016-08-16 11:47:22
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/765515289719148544
10) That could have significant foreign policy consequences. Particularly if any of those operations targeted US allies.

2016-08-16 11:48:09
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/765515485706330113
11) Particularly if any of those operations targeted elections.

2016-08-16 11:48:40
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/765515619584311296
12) Accordingly, this may be an effort to influence the calculus of decision-makers wondering how sharply to respond to the DNC hacks.

2016-08-16 11:49:44
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/765515884647636992
13) TL;DR: This leak looks like a somebody sending a message that an escalation in the attribution game could get messy fast.

2016-08-16 11:50:28
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/765516071696760832
Bonus: When I came forward, NSA would have migrated offensive operations to new servers as a precaution - it's cheap and easy. So? So...

2016-08-16 11:50:55
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/765516183709814784
The undetected hacker squatting on this NSA server lost access in June 2013. Rare public data point on the positive results of the leak.

@Snowden Their report is so artlessly distorted that it would be amusing if it weren't such a serious act of bad faith. Let's take examples:

2016-09-15 21:31:57
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/776534039754932225
@Snowden The claim I exfiltrated data for journos 8 months prior to Clapper? False. That was HEARTBEAT (see film), an approved data handler.

2016-09-15 21:41:42
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/776536497419943940
@Snowden HEARTBEAT, which seems to be the source of their 1.5m number, was explicited authorized by two levels of my management. I built it.

I could go on forever. It is an endless parade of falsity so unbelievable it comes across as parody. Yet unintentionally exonerating:

They document me going, again and again -- over years, despite punishments -- to superiors to report complaints of waste, fraud, and abuse.

2016-12-22 16:37:15
https://www.twitter.com/snowden/status/811973890771734528
They characterize many of the best things I ever did -- standing up for co-workers, reporting XSS vulns in TS/SCI systems -- as wrongs.

Bottom line: this report's core claims are made without evidence, and are often contrary to both common sense and the public record.
