2015-05-16 19:38:17
https://www.twitter.com/repadamschiff/status/599660157820346368
Willingness to mount an effort to capture Abu Sayyaf underscores importance of cutting off ISIS resources &amp; Admin's determination to do so.

2015-05-16 19:42:54

Temp expiration of Sec 215 is a lose-lose, slowing momentum towards lasting reform &amp; throwing uncontroversial NatSec tools into confusion.

The latest breach, which has exposed personal information of more than 4 million current &amp; former federal employees is among most shocking.

2015-06-04 21:49:37

Death of Nasir al-Wuhayshi – leader of AQAP &amp; #2 to Ayman Al Zawahiri – is significant blow to core Al Qaeda &amp; its most dangerous franchise.

https://www.twitter.com/repadamschiff/status/610866902148206592

Europe is facing a real threat from the thousands who have traveled abroad to Syria and Iraq to train with ISIS, and have returned home.

Trump must divest completely to prevent conflicts of interest. Why?
 
The Constitution's Emoluments Clause. What’s that? Let me explain:

2016-12-22 15:58:31
https://www.twitter.com/repadamschiff/status/811964141753790464
The Emoluments Clause isn’t well known, but it was very important to the Framers who worried about foreign influence in a young Republic.

2016-12-22 15:58:58
https://www.twitter.com/repadamschiff/status/811964252470857728
It simply provides that no federal office holder can accept payment from a foreign nation without the explicit approval of Congress.

2016-12-22 16:00:18
https://www.twitter.com/repadamschiff/status/811964588367417345
There’s no question the Emoluments Clause applies to POTUS – including Trump. Severe remedies if its violated, including impeachment.

2016-12-22 16:01:03
https://www.twitter.com/repadamschiff/status/811964776955912193
Trump’s very attached to his businesses. Easy to imagine he'll be affected by his own perceptions of how countries deal with his company.

2016-12-22 16:02:15
https://www.twitter.com/repadamschiff/status/811965082662031360
Given Trump’s lack of transparency on taxes and business interests, many of these potential conflicts will be hidden from public.

2016-12-22 16:04:38
https://www.twitter.com/repadamschiff/status/811965680824238082
Foreign states will tread carefully around Trump’s private interests, hoping to avoid his wrath and curry favor. We've seen this already.

2016-12-22 16:05:43
https://www.twitter.com/repadamschiff/status/811965952535498756
They'll assume it's advantageous to promote a Trump organization, stay at Trump hotels or eliminate hurdles to Trump developments.

2016-12-22 16:07:11
https://www.twitter.com/repadamschiff/status/811966322401800193
What if a country pays fair market price to stay in a Trump hotel? Not good enough. The Clause prohibits payment even for services rendered.

2016-12-22 16:09:05
https://www.twitter.com/repadamschiff/status/811966800082636800
Imagine if Trump's gratitude or anger bleeds out – muddying America's foreign policy in ways that elude accountability.
