2017-02-19 14:53:01
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/833328540623986690

https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/833328865191796736

2017-02-25 22:44:05
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/835621417945346049
2. N33LR is used with two different planes and serial numbers a GV and G1v, but same transponder number

2017-02-25 22:44:57
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/835621635415769088
finally 3. the N33LR GV - sharing transponder w N33LR GIV - is by serial number N795BA - differernt ttransponder

https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/839172227488706560
So, revised question: If Trump can declassify #natsec in tweet, is he allowed to reveal evidence in an ongoing legal crim case (3rd branch)?

2017-03-07 17:54:45
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/839172482565304326
@stellacle indeed. But doesn't that give the President power to mess with third branch if info is evidence in a legal case, as here?

2017-03-07 18:02:59
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/839174555293859846
It was financial offenses (money laundering was one) also involving national security (hence FISA). So can Trump tweet evidence in case?

But. When Putin and Wikileaks push at you that it was "A DNC insider" who is not a Russian, that's who Steele said was Trump/RIS mole.

https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/840558108510412800
Yes. @ericgarland is right. Comey did not get his warrant at all until October 15. He follows the law. This investigation is fast.

2017-03-11 13:42:27
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/840558540502765570
To us living it every day seems slow I grant you. In history books will read something like "Trump lasted less than a year. Pence commuted"

2017-03-11 13:43:36
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/840558828395610112
"Pence commuted Trump's sentence on grounds of dementia. Hundreds of admin, former FBI and collaborators were jailed". That'll be history.

On Pence and Flynn, quickly. Maybe he knew but I doubt it. I have been an MP, equiv congressman. Because you send letter doesn't mean read

2017-03-11 13:46:32
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/840559568556023808
If a junior figure in legislature emails VP at mad busy time is no guarantee Pence saw letter, that's no. 1

2017-03-11 13:47:17
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/840559757094244352
Number 2, Flynn was indeed grilled by Pence. Pence may have asked Flynn about that very letter accusations if he did read it

2017-03-11 13:48:13
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/840559990985367554
Number 3. Flynn overtly lied to Pence twice. Once on son's security clearance. Second re Russian Amvassador. Why not FARA too?

2017-03-11 13:49:04
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/840560207168208897
Pls note I don't "defend" Pence. I'm saying for me as letter writing MP no guarantee Chancellor of Exchequer personally reads all MP stuff.

https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/848384569162289153
@mcuban let's be clear and drop the side issue of "coordinating" you claim Trump was completely unaware, yes? So his taxes are clean?

2017-04-02 04:01:37
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/848384900667518977
@mcuban see he picked bad real estate that Dimitry Rybolovev paid twice market for then tore down. That's one example of money laundering.

Big insight learned from reporting on world of hacks and hackers. 1. they are all much cleverer than I am but 2. They are all vain = sloppy

2017-04-04 03:05:45
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849095617104293888
Without exception thus far, hackers get caught through social media because they want, even need, to tell you who they are. They tell you.

2017-04-04 03:06:28
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849095797622919168
sort of like the killer leaving cryptic clues. all hackers secretly need significance for their real selves and their nicknames won't do it.

2017-04-04 03:07:40
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849096098752999424
So hackers lay trails of breadcrumbs and are then always amazed (and deeply pissed off) when somebody finds the loaf.

2017-04-04 03:08:12
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849096236464562176
So you do not need to be a hacker to catch a hacker you just need an eye for pattern, patience, and willingness to listen to what they say.

2017-04-04 03:09:11
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849096480774377472
And you need to be OK with a few false starts but you'll get them in the end. That's everyone, including the @GUCCIFER_2 gang #Chayanov

2017-04-04 03:11:10
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849096982043951107
And then one more thing about hackers. They are all "boss fight" on social media but their skin is tissue-paper thin. There are zero "lulz"

2017-04-04 03:13:08
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849097475646521344
and it is BLOODY IMPOSSIBLE to gauge hackers' emotions. you think they are joking when they are actually mortally offended and/or ragey.

2017-04-04 03:14:43
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849097873644015621
but important bit is that hackers always always need to tell you who they are and then get annoyed when you listen and find out @GUCCIFER_2

https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849284543320346624
We have to make it clear to Russia's businessmen that active measures against the West will be met with drastic, terrible punishment.

2017-04-04 15:37:11
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849284722769498113
Russia does understand weakness and kindness. The next Executive must show no mercy to Russia or Putin. Retaliation must be immense

2017-04-04 15:38:16
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849284994996613121
Sanctions should be quintupled. Russia denied SWIFT banking. all surrounding nations admitted to NATO. That's part 1.

2017-04-04 15:39:19
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849285259342565376
Part 2 should be immediate removal of Assad, expulsion of Russia from Syrian port. Publicize, in Russia, all of Putin's hidden wealth

2017-04-04 15:40:14
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849285491170172928
Part 3. Take away from all complicit oligarchs, including if true Abramovitch and Rybolovev, their Western assets. Kick Russian mob from NY

2017-04-04 15:40:58
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849285673496477696
Part 4. Ban all variants of Sputnik and RT from the West. Interview all their "journalists" who we know to be spies and expel them.

2017-04-04 15:42:11
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849285981475876864
Part 5. US and should deal with all nations on the borders of Russia to buy territory, which will become sovereign US territory, for bases

2017-04-04 15:43:08
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849286218089197570
Part 6. the West and #FVEY should encourage Active Measures within Russia until Putin and all his allies are gone and Russians are free.

2017-04-04 15:44:03
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849286449614794752
Part 7. As the price of lifting crippling sanctions Russia should be forced to hand over not only @Snowden but all its hackers and code #SVB

https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849720194448506880
So @RosieGray again gets the story from Trump side of White House, this time re Strahan joining Sputnik. The reason for this is simple

2017-04-05 20:28:17
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849720366213627904
Just like @CassandraRules, Stranahan was communicating with @Guccifer_2. Just like Cass, he tried to hide that in plain sight on Periscope.

2017-04-05 20:29:01
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849720551589396480
Hence @SputnikInt takes to itself all the "journalists" Russia has been using to work with @GUCCIFER_2 on the Verita hack and state hacks

2017-04-05 20:29:45
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849720738613297152
.@RosieGray published the wrongful story by @MichaelCohen212 that he was in LA when his twitter placed him at Newark. Would never correct.

2017-04-05 20:30:29
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849720920339906560
II'm incredibly unsurprised @RosieGray has another Bannon-side "scoop" that @SputnikInt is sheltering an @GUCCIFER_2 correspondent

2017-04-05 20:31:37
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849721207930757120
Stranahan walked out of a White House press conference and made sure to Periscope his confession he communicated with @Guccifer_2 (hostkey)

2017-04-05 20:32:15
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/849721365624111104

For the record. The @nytimes keeps up its record of being UNFAILINGLY WRONG on #TrumpRussia and #FISA. There was a FISC application in June.

#Assange if confirmed, @FBI charges would likely change matters for the United Kingdom. Espionage is not diplomacy. We could expel embassy.

2017-04-21 00:42:26
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/855220145349906432
The U.K. has respected @MashiRafael **diplomatic** asylum for @JulianAssange. But spying on our ally not a valid embassy function. #FVEY

2017-04-21 00:43:42
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/855220463475339264
Formal charges of espionage against @JulianAssange would likely result in U.K. kicking out @MashiRafael embassy if not surrender #Assange.

2017-04-21 00:44:43
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/855220718119858177
And if Ecuador loses the right to an embassy in London because @MashiRafael attacked the USA from it, we can simply arrest #Assange at once.

2017-04-21 00:51:02
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/855222310248345600

https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/855542594813779968

Want to send all the Muslims on my feed a big hug. One thing unifies all the Russian propaganda around the world and that is Islamiphobia

2017-04-22 18:46:24
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/855855322501697538
It is becoming ever clearer that a great many of the terrorist attacks attributed to "radical Islam" were bought and paid for by @PutinRF

2017-04-22 18:47:31
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/855855603004166144
This includes Boston and Oslo, where the terrorists were Russian. In other cases it means that Russia paid off terrorists to commit murder

2017-04-22 18:48:26
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/855855833871253504
Russian active measures are acts of war. Like cowards, Russia cowers behind a bogeyman of "radical Islam" it creates and funds itself

2017-04-22 18:53:01

I know that the Hadiths say that as to prisoners of war the prophet Muhammad, pbuh, fed captives before even his own soldiers

So no, ISIS are not Islam and Saudi Arabia is not Islam. The wahhabist sect are khawarij. Excuse my spelling. ((Muslims))

I am a Catholic if a sorry excuse for one but we are all People of the Book. Nobody demonizes Muslims more than @PutinRF. Global scapegoat

If a person follows Islam they will not harm another person but do good in the world. Now I don't share this faith. But I respect Muslims

2017-04-24 22:38:58
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/856638626456850432
I'm perplexed at the absolute power Nunes and Chaffetz appear to have had over their committees - is it majority vote or chairman's will?

2017-04-24 22:40:10
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/856638925967958016
@WillieCConway how so? Say Nunes wants to cancel a scheduled hearing is there a vote or he can just do it?

2017-04-24 22:41:53
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/856639360841768961
It seems that Burr, Nunes and Chaffetz could do as they liked without a committee vote on each issue is that right or wrong?

Thread. So everyone knows why @KremlinTrolls work matters. Let's take example of @Noclador, defended by both @Bernstein and @AlanaGoodman

2017-04-28 15:33:54
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/857981207048581120
Thomas Theiner, @Noclador, DMed me when I was researching @MichaelCohen212 - he claimed Cohen used an Israeli passport to go to Prague

2017-04-28 15:34:59
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/857981479497809922
Theiner had a "Europe source" on this he would never produce. Members of the IC warned me on @Noclador as a disinfo merchant #TeamDeza

https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/857981820478140416
Next friends of mine got DMs from @KremlinTrolls @Noclador, best pal of fellow Russia troll @GicAriana,  attacking @20Committee

2017-04-28 15:37:22
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/857982079056973824
Don't wish to give John a big head but obsessively attacking @20Committee is usually a pretty good tell of an @KreminTrolls like @Noclador

2017-04-28 15:38:22
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/857982330002132992
Now here is where @KremlinTrolls work is REALLY useful. He proved @Noclador made pro-Kremlin Wikipedia edits IN EVERY LANGUAGE

2017-04-28 15:39:45
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/857982676942323713
Once you establish Thomas Theiner, @Noclador, edits Wikipedia in every language to make pro-Kremlin edits, tells you a lot about his backers

2017-04-28 15:41:17
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/857983063632031744
So @GicAriana is BFFs with a fake oppo account @Noclador that spread @MichaelCohen212 #Deza and makes pro-Kremlin edits around the clock.

2017-04-28 15:42:41
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/857983415676784640
Thus @KremlinTrolls work is  more than 'handbags at dawn'. It sheds light on #TeamDeza fake opposition that is actually pure Russia. Ends.

https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/859561976112066560
I'm going to game out @TrueFactsStated scoop on the Trump Obstruction Call. Thread, to be clear this is all guessing.

2017-05-03 00:16:32
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/859562282182995968
Ok so Claude says Trump was on tape saying he would try to shut down the investigation; an ally leaked it; it was an overseas call

2017-05-03 00:17:55
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/859562630759034881
My guess (nothing but a guess) is that this call was made to Nigel Farage or if he was REALLY dumb Assange but much more likely Nigel Farage

2017-05-03 00:18:34
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/859562793326006272
I think this because as PEOTUS and before Trump had no power nor did he know how much USIC had on him

2017-05-03 00:19:11
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/859562950356553730
Secondly because Trump is as thick as two short planks and only speaks English - unlikely to confide to a translator

2017-05-03 00:20:07
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/859563183782207488
Thirdly because dates of Farage travels pre-and-post election match key Russiagate events - I say he was a courier

2017-05-03 00:21:00
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/859563407728660481
Fourthly my bet is Trump called Farage night before Farage went to see Assange in the embassy to convey Trump's message

2017-05-03 00:22:10
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/859563697437593600
Fifthly I bet Pompeo and Morrell are sweating like pigs right now and so they fucking should be - volunteers in a kill TrumpRussia campaign

2017-05-03 00:22:59
https://www.twitter.com/louisemensch/status/859563903336022016
Sixthly if I'm right this glorious news means Farage and all those about him have been being intercepted by GCHQ under a warrant for AGES

2017-05-03 00:37:03
