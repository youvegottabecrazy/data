https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/49474772471529472
So, what's wrong with this picture (Libya)? Here's what:

2011-03-20 14:26:55
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/49477020509417472
#1. If the Arab League supports this military action, why haven't they sent in their Arab troops and planes in real amounts? Uh-huh

2011-03-20 14:48:00
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/49482324022263810
#2. Our job is 2 prop up Arab dictators (Saudi, Yemen, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan, etc), not overthrow them & everyone in Arab world knows it

2011-03-20 14:49:51
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/49482789850062849
#3. So knock off "it's our moral obligation 2 defend ppl of Libya." After Iraq & Afghan & support of dictators, we have no moral standing.

2011-03-20 14:51:22
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/49483172181839872
#4. Too little, too late. So NOW we try 2 help the Libyans after Khaddafy has retaken most of country? Really just a big show, isn't it?

2011-03-20 14:57:09
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/49484629882843136
#5. We have neither the troops, stomach, or $$ to fight a ground war for months/years to defeat MK. So can we get back to the NCAA?

2011-03-20 15:15:43
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/49489299040768000
#6. Unrest forced France & others 2 close down their oil shipping from Libya. Khaddafy then offered China, 3rd World France's oil. Oops.

2011-03-20 15:28:18
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/49492466654642176

OK. Let's hear from the "liberals" who say this is a just war because we're protecting innocent Libyans--like that's what we do!

Ok, I'm now out of Twitter Jail (as Roseanne Cash calls it). Here's how I think, IMHO, we can help the Libyan people...

2011-03-21 00:53:58
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/49634822175473664
#1. This appears to be a civil war in Libya. Not a war of genocide. Not a revolution. One thing's clear: None of us want Khadaffy to win.

2011-03-21 00:55:03
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/49635093941190656
#2. But who is the opposition? Don't send weapons 2 rebels til u know who they r! Last time we did that we armed bin Laden & the Taliban.

2011-03-21 00:56:18
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/49635410120425472
#3. Stop lying. Quit saying "Khadaffy's not the target." Really? If he's the target... Then spend a decade cleaning up the mess left behind.

2011-03-21 00:57:27
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/49635697212137473
#4.If the rebels want a democracy then support them w/ the arms they need. But u must do same 2 help Bahrain/Yemen or u have no credibility.

2011-03-21 01:00:59
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/49636590301097984
#5.But let the Euros do it. Libya is 172mi fr Eurp (closer than Flint is 2 Chicago). The French helped us 230yrs ago & that worked out ok...

2011-03-21 01:02:28
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/49636961002061824
#6. ...for us. Not so good for Louis XVI. Be careful what u wish for.

We fired over 100 Tomahawk missiles into Libya this weekend @ over $600K-1M a missile. Each missile would pay for 12-20 teachers in US.

https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/50146914733273088
Don't miss the point here. Qaddafi's a brutal dictator. But who are these rebels we're helping? Are we not allowed to ask that question?

2011-03-22 10:52:06
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/50147737303388160
What's dispiriting about this is that for 2 months, WITHOUT U.S. help, ppl from Tunisia 2 Egypt & beyond rose up peacefully & were winning.

The Libyan War is 1 wk old. How 'bout we list the things we can all agree on whether we're for, against or undecided about the intervention?

2011-03-26 18:33:57
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/51713514456354816
#1. Qaddafi must go. A truly sick and evil man. Shoulda been gone a long time ago.

2011-03-26 18:35:27
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/51713893348802560
#2. All the world's dictators should go. Including the ones in Yemen, Bahrain, Jordan Syria & Saudi Arabia.

2011-03-26 18:40:09
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/51715075215597568
#3. The French were right to take an immediate, specific and precise action to stop the Libyan army from advancing on civilians in Benghazi.

2011-03-26 18:42:15
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/51715605304320000
#4. Obama was right 2go2 the U.N.&ArabLeague instead of acting unilaterally. He was right 2 say our lead in this would be "days, not weeks."

2011-03-26 18:47:54
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/51717025764089856
#5. We're not quite sure who makes up the Libyan revolt, but in principle we should support all secular democracy movements in the MidEast.

2011-03-26 18:51:34
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/51717947449815040
#6. We cannot fight a 3rd ground war in the MidEast. We need 2 go 2 the war time-out room. We can be supportive in other ways.

2011-03-26 18:56:19
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/51719145221390338
#7. We have no credibility if we don't immed. back the protesters in Bahrain/ Yemen/Jordan. And we must stop selling arms 2 guys like MQ.

2011-03-26 19:01:55
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/51720553807093762

Now the things we may not agree on, but I believe in my conscience: ...

2011-03-26 20:33:11
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/51743522017124352
A. Stop saying we're part of a "coalition." We are THE war machine. Our mil budget is bigger than almost ALL the world's countries COMBINED.

2011-03-26 20:38:45
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/51744923136966656
B. Let the democracy movement in Libya & elsewhere conduct their own revolutions. There are ways to support (if asked) without military.

2011-03-26 20:40:48
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/51745437857759232
C. The wave of democratic nonviolent revolution in MidEast was going just fine. We can support them by STOPPING our support of the regimes.

2011-03-26 20:54:51
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/51748975983861760
E. GE, etc. pay no taxes. But they make huge profits off war. Meanwhile Detroit will have 62 students per classroom. They r taking us down.

2011-03-26 21:05:50
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/51751738167926785
F. Finally & most importantly, we need our own pro-democracy movement here in the U.S. It started in Madison-lets make it happen everywhere.

#1. TitleofSpeech:"Mission Accomplished!" Let's hope so. What about "Gadhafi must go"? Nah, never mind. No mention U.S. trained/armed Libya.

2011-03-29 02:24:49
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/52556787467026432
#2. He made this clear: No more Iraqs. No ground troops in Libya.  This was good news. He essentially admitted Iraq was a huge f-up.

2011-03-29 02:26:23
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/52557184558567424

Usually when there's a protest in America, there's at least a small counter protest from the "other side.

2011-10-03 04:29:45
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/120717146262220801
16 days into #OccupyWallStreet - ZERO counter protest. Where's the "pro-banker" movement? Exactly. 72% of the public says "TAX THE RICH!"

Has anyone else but me noticed that movies projected in theaters these days appear darker on the screen than usual?

2011-12-13 22:06:34
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/146712641711243264
Have all these digital projectors wrecked the movie-going experience? Are they using the cheaper lamps to save $$?

2011-12-13 22:08:38
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/146713162283098112
Is it because the projectionists (are there "projectionists" these days?) leave the 3D apparatus on the projector when showing a 2D movie?

2011-12-13 22:18:13
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/146715575551393792
Is it because 3D requires a silver screen and thus theaters have switched to them instead of a white screen which is what film requires?

So the crappy look on the screen at your local multiplex is not the filmmaker's fault. Corp theater chains are trying to get by on the cheap

Automated digital projectors, 3D filters that are not taken off to show a 2D movie- they are killing their own business.

General feeling is movement needs less talk, more action. Actions that are creative & nonviolent & gum up the works of an evil system. #ows

Set up an "Occupy" on your street, in your school, etc. It's not about tents-it's about gathering ppl like u from the 99% & raising ur voice

https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/149930355682582528
To Occupy is to simply take charge: "This is OUR country, OUR Congress, OUR economy, OUR jobs, OUR future-& we refuse to let the 1% own it!"

This isn't rocket science. It's not because the Romney's are rich that they don't have a clue - it's simply because THEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE!

Or, worse, they DO have a clue - and they know the only way they & their ilk can get RICHER is by taking it from the middle class.

Obama seemed incredibly distracted and somewhere else. His mind wasn't on the debate. What was he told before he went on the stage?

2012-10-04 16:21:59
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/253892735034077185

Everyone could see that wasn't the Obama that we know on that stage.Just before the debate was he told something that shook him off balance?

2012-10-05 13:10:02
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/254206816957906944
That debate had nothing 2do w/Romney's "superior" debating skills or Obama's "poor performance."The real story is finding out what happened.

Of course. Criminals will always kill, rob, rape, extort, defraud, etc  so does that mean we should do nothing?

2012-12-28 03:50:51
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/284506675489169408
Why have guards @ banks if there's always gonna be bank robberies? Why have laws for murders? I mean, that won't stop every murder.

Obama, like all Dems, has been scared of the NRA 4 years(ever c a Repub afraid of liberals?). I'd say, not any more. We will see the ban now

2012-12-28 04:01:50

2012-12-28 04:08:04
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/284511008121303041
Correct. Bush let the ban expire. And Obama ignored it in first term.

2012-12-28 04:10:13
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/284511548586749952
In part because the majority of guns in the US are owned by white ppl in rural and suburban areas. That fact is rarely reported.

No. I make no money from any airing    or sale of BFC. I also took no salary in making the movie.

As for gun laws I would ban auto &amp; semi-automatic guns, ban clips or magazines w/ more than 7 bullets, tax bullets to pay for mental health

2012-12-31 03:46:31
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/285592744645255170
Also: every gun must be registered and every gun owner subjected to passing tests to get a license. Oh, and I would repeal the 2nd amendment

2012-12-31 03:54:26
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/285594738286030850
1st thing to do would be to stop our official use of killing to solve our country's problems.  Cut Pentagon by 50%, end death penalty, etc.

Emad Burnat, Palestinian director of Oscar nominated "5 Broken Cameras" was held tonight by immigration at LAX as he landed to attend Oscars

2013-02-20 07:41:51
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/304133749443026944
Emad, his wife &amp; 8-yr old son were placed in a holding area and told they didn't have the proper invitation on them to attend the Oscars.

2013-02-20 07:56:23
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/304137408906137602
Although he produced the Oscar invite nominees receive, that wasn't good enough &amp; he was threatened with being sent back to Palestine.

2013-02-20 08:00:44
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/304138505020387328
Apparently the Immigration &amp; Customs officers couldn't understand how a Palestinian could be an Oscar nominee. Emad texted me for help.

2013-02-20 08:05:59
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/304139826637180928

Time's up. Buzzfeed today tried to raise doubts that Oscar nominee, Palestinian filmmaker Emad Burnat wasn't really detained at LAX on Tues.

2013-02-26 02:06:12
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/306223608114601985
Buzzfeed quotes a "source" at LAX who said that Burnat was simply asked to produce his ticket to the Oscars and when he "couldn't" he was...

2013-02-26 03:05:09
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/306238443657232386
Nobody, no nominee, had their tickets on Tuesday because the Academy didn't release them to Oscar-goers until 2 days later -- on Thursday.

2013-02-26 03:06:03
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/306238671995146240
It's that way every year. Oscar tickets are available only on Thursday through Saturday, the day before the Oscars...

2013-02-26 03:08:26
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/306239269276626944
But your "source" says Burnat finally produced a ticket 2 the show while they were detaining him &amp; his family on TUES &amp; then they let him in

2013-02-26 03:11:28
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/306240034917478402
So that's just an outright lie. Completely fabricated and easy to disprove with 1 call to the Academy. But why do that?...

2013-02-26 03:12:57
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/306240408902594560
When the intent of your "story" was to cast doubt on this Palestinian who was being threatened with deportation last Tuesday night at LAX...

2013-02-26 03:22:52
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/306242902860906496
So he stepped up to the Customs desk, said he's a Palestinian olive farmer-&amp; an Oscar nominated director. Oh, &amp; his wife is wearing a hijab

2013-02-26 03:26:10
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/306243734452973569
And then he was held &amp; questioned &amp; threatened with being sent back to the Middle East. He texted me, and I told him we'd get right on it...

https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/306268852520636416

For those of u just joining us, Buzzfeed is now busy trying 2 cover its ass 4 claiming Palestinian Oscar nom Emad Burnat wasn't "held" @ LAX

2013-02-26 21:30:56
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/306516726047207426
They now know that they didn't have "multiple sources" (just Homeland Security playing them) and that there were no Oscar tickets last Tues.

2013-02-26 21:37:44
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/306518434777276416
Buzzfeed also knows that the voting for the Oscars was already over, so Emad Burnat had no need to create a "publicity stunt."

We are a scared ppl. Plus,18% of Americans live in poverty. In Canada, it's a little over 1%. That's why Canadians don't lock their doors.

Pope Francis. He's a Jesuit. Jesuits have been a thorn in the side of the Vatican because they ask questions. They're smart. They dissent.

This Jesuit was a scientist before he was priest. Science? Whoa. He refused to live in the Bishop's palace-he lives in an apt &amp;rides the bus

Don't know what any of this means, just trying to be positive on Day 1. The Church must change, must repent. Has the chance to do good.

He was afraid 2 release the 47% video- his life could be "ruined." Then 1 nite he looked in the mirror &amp; said "You're a coward." That did it

(1/5)Jeez. Once again the MPAA has given a film of mine an "R" rating, citing "violence, drug use &amp; brief graphic nudity." Here's the truth:

2015-11-02 21:02:16
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/661287231647125504
(2/5) The "violence" in WHERE TO INVADE NEXT is footage of the NYPD officers killing an unarmed Eric Garner on a Staten Island sidewalk.

2015-11-02 21:04:24
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/661287766701928448
(3/5) The "drug use" in WHERE TO INVADE NEXT is me showing how Portugal ended their "war on drugs". Haven't arrested a 1 drug user in 15yrs.

2015-11-02 21:07:41
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/661288592199708673
(4/5) The "brief nudity" in my film is 2 secs of Germans whose health care card gives em 3 free wks @ a spa if stressed. Don't show us that!

2015-11-02 21:09:41
https://www.twitter.com/mmflint/status/661289098468945920
(5/5) That's what the MPAA doesn't want teenagers 2 see w/o parental supervision. As always, teens: You know what 2 do, u know how 2 get in.

Sorry Bernie lost. He got 43% of the 1.6M allowed to vote. The 3.2M independents, though, couldn't vote. Bernie usually gets 65-70% of them.
