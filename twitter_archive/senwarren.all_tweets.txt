Congress should be making it easier for Americans to file their taxes, not bowing to the interests of the tax prep industry.

Today I introduced the Tax Filing Simplification Act to help taxpayers file with less stress &amp; fewer costs.

My bill directs the IRS to develop a free, online tax prep &amp; filing service that taxpayers can use directly w/ the gov.

2016-04-13 18:39:28
https://www.twitter.com/senwarren/status/720320514514792448
It prohibits the IRS from entering into agreements w/ tax prep companies that restrict its ability to provide free online services.

2016-04-13 18:39:52
https://www.twitter.com/senwarren/status/720320615199023104
The Tax Filing Simplification Act lets taxpayers download third-party-reported tax information that the IRS already has.

2016-04-13 18:40:19
https://www.twitter.com/senwarren/status/720320729753866240
And the Tax Filing Simplification Act provides a return-free option for those with simple tax situations.

Today, after an extensive review, fed regulators concluded that 5 of the biggest banks are still Too Big to Fail. https://t.co/zZNeA8HjrN

2016-04-13 20:54:45
https://www.twitter.com/senwarren/status/720354561408528384
5 US banks are big enough that any one could crash the economy again if they failed &amp; weren’t bailed out. It’s a very big deal. It’s scary.

2016-04-13 20:55:34
https://www.twitter.com/senwarren/status/720354768409927685
Unless the banks promptly address regulators’ concerns, the gov must push these banks to get smaller &amp; less complex.

Who thinks the central problem in America is that middle class families have too much health care &amp; rich people need more gov handouts?

There's no other way to say it: #Trumpcare is just part of a GOP plan to help the rich get richer &amp; kick dirt in everyone else's face.

Consider what #Trumpcare will do to families &amp; communities struggling with the opioid crisis. We already have an opioid treatment gap.

Gutting the ACA with #Trumpcare is like shoving a stick of dynamite in this country’s opioid treatment gap &amp; lighting the fuse.

Today I told the Senate: If #Trumpcare passes, people will lose access to opioid recovery services. People will die. https://t.co/6x34DLVk61

Now is the time to speak out about the importance of the ACA &amp; Medicaid to your family &amp; stop this cruel #Trumpcare bill in its tracks.

Turns out, an illegal Muslim ban by another name is still an illegal Muslim ban. So the courts just blocked @realDonaldTrump's second one.

.@realDonaldTrump's illegal Muslim ban is still a recruiting tool for ISIS. Still a betrayal of our values. Still doesn't keep us safe.

.@realDonaldTrump, your Muslim ban is now 0 for 2 vs the Constitution. Stop fighting the rule of law and start fighting for all Americans.

We don’t need another Supreme Court justice to help giant corporations. We need a justice who will uphold equal justice for all.

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos apparently thinks her job is to hand @usedgov over to people who want to bilk students.

https://www.twitter.com/senwarren/status/843992032150458369
I asked Betsy DeVos why 2 of her key aides are fmr for-profit college execs with massive conflicts of interest. https://t.co/NGc3oJGERM

https://www.twitter.com/senwarren/status/843992516542251008
The same day I wrote to DeVos about her aides’ obvious conflicts, one of them apparently resigned. https://t.co/KIw0enbJ8O

The damage has already been done. @usedgov announced it would let student loan companies charge some struggling students outrageous fees.

https://www.twitter.com/senwarren/status/843993341670965248
The DeVos aide who resigned last week? His dad happened to run the student loan company that sued @usedgov about that pro-borrower policy.

https://www.twitter.com/senwarren/status/843993979070959618
Transparency, pressure &amp; activism work. But we’re going to need a whole lot more of it to make @usedgov work for students.

The @CFPB is a tough watchdog for working families, forcing big banks to return more than $12B to people they cheated.

2017-03-21 14:03:36
https://www.twitter.com/senwarren/status/844187740484919297
The @CFPB is widely popular with the American people – and widely hated by the big Wall Street banks it regulates.

https://www.twitter.com/senwarren/status/844188029828907009
Today, the GOP @FinancialCmte has a hearing about “restructuring” the @CFPB – another way of saying they want to weaken it.

2017-03-21 14:05:48
https://www.twitter.com/senwarren/status/844188293591982080
Instead of siding with the big banks, the @HouseGOP should join @HouseDemocrats in ensuring that the @CFPB remains a strong cop on the beat.

Neil Gorsuch is up for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court from a President whose campaign is under FBI investigation.

https://www.twitter.com/senwarren/status/844300763774029829
I've strongly opposed the Gorsuch nomination. Giant companies don't need another Supreme Court justice to tilt the law in their favor.

2017-03-21 21:33:45
https://www.twitter.com/senwarren/status/844301026693955584
But is the Senate really going to pretend there's no cloud over @realDonaldTrump &amp; move on w/ the Gorsuch nomination like things are normal?

2017-03-21 21:34:58
https://www.twitter.com/senwarren/status/844301331259183104
The FBI Director testified @realDonaldTrump's campaign is under investigation for collusion w/ Russia. Lifetime court appointments can wait.

.@SenMarkey is right: the @FCC protected consumers by adopting #BroadbandPrivacy rules – on how companies collect/use/share/sell our data.

2017-03-22 17:37:11
https://www.twitter.com/senwarren/status/844603879182471168
Now the @SenateGOP is obsessed with using the Congressional Review Act to kill every consumer protection rule in sight, like the @FCC rules.

2017-03-22 17:39:45
https://www.twitter.com/senwarren/status/844604526191689737
The @SenateGOP would undo @FCC rules &amp; let internet service providers sell private info without telling customers.
