Today I’m joining @emilyslist &amp; @SenGillibrand to #rallywomen to vote on 11/4, because the deck is stacked against women most of all.

https://www.twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/524969673461600256
Bloomberg found women earn less in 99.6% of jobs, but women can still be fired for asking what the guy down the hall makes. #rallywomen

2014-10-22 17:07:31
https://www.twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/524970314393206784
More young women are going to college than ever, but 71% of students graduate with crushing debt. #rallywomen

2/3 of minimum wage workers are women, but the minimum wage no longer keeps a mom &amp; her baby out of poverty. #rallywomen

2014-10-22 17:15:01

Since women earn less over lifetime, they receive on avg $4k/yr less in Social Security – but they rely on the checks most. #rallywomen

11 big banks are still so risky that if any one started to fail, they'd need a gov bailout or risk taking down the economy – again.

2016-01-06 15:09:53

2016-01-08 17:13:43
https://www.twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/685509700251742210
Hank Greenberg left his company just before AIG took a $182 billion bailout from the Bush Administration…

2016-01-08 17:14:07
https://www.twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/685509801498009601
Once his GOP friends left office, Greenberg sued the Obama Administration because – get this – the bailout wasn’t generous enough for him…

2016-01-08 17:14:43
https://www.twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/685509950504833024

6 yrs ago today, @BarackObama signed Dodd-Frank, the Wall St reform bill that was a powerful step towards holding the big banks accountable.

2016-07-21 21:37:25
https://www.twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/756241695310839818
Dodd-Frank wasn’t perfect – we still have more work to do to make sure the big banks don’t bring down our economy again.

2016-07-21 21:38:19
https://www.twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/756241923451523072
One thing we definitely got right in Dodd-Frank was the @CFPB. Wall St can't cheat people on mortgages, credit cards &amp; student loans.

2016-07-21 21:39:14
https://www.twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/756242154113134596

2016-07-21 21:41:24
https://www.twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/756242699984994305
