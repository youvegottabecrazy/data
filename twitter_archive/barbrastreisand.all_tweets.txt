How ridiculous to read that I shut down Staples Center during my rehearsal.  Then who were the hundreds of people I was singing to?

2011-02-13 21:11:19

I was a member of the glee club in high school, me and Neil Diamond.

I love the fact that “Glee” is bringing back songs that young people
might otherwise not hear.

2011-02-13 21:11:49
https://www.twitter.com/barbrastreisand/status/36895340334419968
And I like that it’s about misfits and outsiders, because that’s what I was as a young girl.

2011-02-13 21:11:59
https://www.twitter.com/barbrastreisand/status/36895381589598208
When asked if I would appear, “Not if I can help it” only meant I
can’t take on any more work right now. Besides, I haven’t been asked.

2011-02-13 21:12:06
https://www.twitter.com/barbrastreisand/status/36895414535856128
I’m so honored that a lead character on “Glee” is so admiring of my
work.

people to music they might otherwise not hear today"...

Reagan raised the debt ceiling 18 times.Under Bush the GOP voted 19 times to raise it.

2011-08-03 03:36:07

https://www.twitter.com/barbrastreisand/status/228264225074712576
NGO funding for breast cancer research is approximately 350-400 million, compared to 9 million for women’s heart disease

2012-07-25 23:03:57
https://www.twitter.com/barbrastreisand/status/228264353617563648
Each year, approx 40,000 women die of breast cancer vs. 500,000 women who die from heart disease. Something is wrong with this picture.

Donald Trump is making me gain weight. I start the day with liquids, but after the morning news, I eat pancakes smothered in maple syrup!

Trump just accused Obama of tapping his phones. Seriously crazy times. Time for more pancakes.

Trump is trying to take credit for 227k jobs in January that came from Obama. The only thing he saved was perhaps 700 with the state’s help

Rather than bringing out the best in people, Trump brings out the beast in people. Hate crimes are up. https://t.co/TTyWktE71P

Why doesn't billionaire Trump pay for his weekend trips and NY apartment instead of taxpayers?

If Trump continues to house family in NYC &amp; vacation at this rate, it will cost taxpayers $526 mill. Arts budget is only 1/4 this cost.
