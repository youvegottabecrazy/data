A thread on how you defeat @realDonaldTrump in 10 parts.

2017-03-19 18:19:20
https://www.twitter.com/shaunking/status/843527321915146240
1. Massive, unheard of, crazy, all out effort, VOTER REGISTRATION. 

Record breaking voter registration. It should've already started.

2017-03-19 18:20:45
https://www.twitter.com/shaunking/status/843527679114727426
2. Running candidates who create strong contrasts with @realDonaldTrump.

They must have:

Integrity
Honesty
Character
Real beliefs &amp; values

2017-03-19 18:22:04
https://www.twitter.com/shaunking/status/843528010175299584
3. Pre-existing movements &amp; campaigns that currently have real momentum and are strongly organized must be asked, BEGGED even, to PARTNER.

2017-03-19 18:23:14
https://www.twitter.com/shaunking/status/843528303264890880
4. Young people must be the lifeblood.  Democrats, for the first time in ages, in Clinton, chose the candidate young people largely opposed.

2017-03-19 18:24:20
https://www.twitter.com/shaunking/status/843528581305286658
5. Democrats must have a deep, true, complex 50 state strategy. Each statewide party must be rebuilt, modernized, energized.

2017-03-19 18:26:50
https://www.twitter.com/shaunking/status/843529211591737344
6. Dirty money, lobbyist money must be removed from Democratic politics. It's not needed for victory or for massive fundraising.

2017-03-19 18:28:09
https://www.twitter.com/shaunking/status/843529542136414208
7. Democrats must hold massive campaign style events in stadiums nationwide. Bernie, Warren, and so many others can lead these events.

2017-03-19 18:29:17
https://www.twitter.com/shaunking/status/843529827919511552
8. Democrats must break down their actual policy ideas into 5-7 key points that can be easily communicated, understood, repeated.

2017-03-19 18:30:28
https://www.twitter.com/shaunking/status/843530124301651968
9. The next presidential campaign has already started. Trump has already said this. Democrats must begin organizing right now. Like, tonight

2017-03-19 18:33:22
https://www.twitter.com/shaunking/status/843530856270651395
10. Lastly, Democrats must work very hard not to fall back into bad habits of what used to work. It doesn't work anymore. Period.
